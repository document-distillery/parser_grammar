     BUSINESS


  History


     XL Capital Ltd, together with its subsidiaries (the “Company” or “XL”), is a leading provider of insurance and reinsurance coverages, and financial products and services toindustrial, commercial and professional service firms, insurance companies and other enterprises on a worldwide basis. XL Capital Ltd was incorporated with limited liability under the Cayman Islands Companies Act on March 16, 1998, as EXEL MergerCompany. XL Capital Ltd was formed as a result of the merger of EXEL Limited and Mid Ocean Limited on August 7, 1998, and the Company was named EXEL Limited on that date.

     EXEL Limited and Mid Ocean are companies that were incorporated in the Cayman Islands in 1986 and 1992, respectively. At a special general meeting held on February 1, 1999, the shareholders ofthe Company approved a resolution changing the name of the Company to XL Capital Ltd.

     On June 18, 1999, XL Capital Ltd merged with NAC Re Corp. (“NAC”), a Delaware corporation organized in 1985, in a stock merger. This merger was accounted for as a pooling of interestsunder U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Following the merger, the Company changed its fiscal year end from November 30 to December 31 as a conforming pooling adjustment.

     On July 25, 2001, the Company acquired certain Winterthur International insurance operations (“Winterthur International”) to extend its predominantly North American-based largecorporate insurance business globally. Results of operations of Winterthur International have been included from July 1, 2001, the date from which the economic interest was transferred to the Company.

     Effective January 1, 2002, the Company increased its shareholding in Le Mans RÉ from 49% to 67% in order to expand its international reinsurance operations. On September 3, 2003, theCompany exercised its option to buy the remaining 33% from MMA for approximately $161 million in cash and changed the name of Le Mans RÉ to XL Re Europe. XL Re Europe underwrites a worldwide portfolio comprising most classes of propertyand casualty reinsurance business, together with a select portfolio of life reinsurance business. See further information under Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Item8, Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Segments

     The Company operates through three business segments: Insurance, Reinsurance and Financial Products and Services. These business segments were determined in accordance with Statement ofFinancial Accounting Standard (“FAS”) No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information” (“FAS 131”). General, life and annuity and financial operations are disclosed separately within eachsegment.

     Following changes in certain executive management responsibilities in January 2005, the Company changed the reporting segments under which certain business units are reported in order toreflect these changes in responsibilities.

     The following areas have been changed for all periods presented:

Results of business structured by XL Financial Solutions Ltd (“XLFS”) are now included entirely within
 the Financial Products and Services segment whereas previously this unit wasreported in all three segments, depending on the nature of individual contracts.Certain blocks of U.S.-based term life mortality reinsurance business previously included in the Financial
 Products and Services segment are now included in the Reinsurance segment asmanagement of these contracts was transferred to the life reinsurance business units in order to centralize the Company's management of traditional mortality-basedreinsurance business.

1

Political risk insurance business units now report to executive management of the Financial Products and
 Services segment and, as such, future earnings from this business are no longerreported in the Insurance
 segment but included with financial operations.All operations of business units within the Financial Products and Services segment, including guaranteed
 investment contracts and funding agreements, are now reported under financialoperations in order to consolidate businesses with similar operating characteristics and risks.All net investment income and net income from affiliates generated by assets and interest expense incurred
 on liabilities of the business units within the Financial Products and Servicessegment is reported under
 financial operations. This income and expense is included in financial operations as it relates to interest on
 portfolios of separately identified andmanaged assets and deposit liabilities. Management believes this
 change better reflects the nature of spread focused business.

     The following table sets forth an analysis of gross premiums written by segment for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Additional financial information about the Company'ssegments, including financial information about geographic areas, is included in Item 8, Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
