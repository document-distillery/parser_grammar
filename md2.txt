        Management's    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of    Operations





 
    OVERVIEW    OF OUR BUSINESS


 
    In general, growth in the telecommunications industry has been    sluggish for the last several years. Demand for some services,    such as wireless and integrated product offerings has increased,    but for many other products and services price compression,    reductions in regulated rates and lower demand have resulted in    year over year revenue declines for many telecommunication    companies. In response to these and other factors, in March 2005    we engaged Jefferies and Company (“Jefferies”) to    present strategic alternatives based on, among other things, the    competitive environment of the telecommunications industry, the    current regulatory environment, and the recent and pending    mergers and acquisitions in our industry. We reviewed    Jefferies' report, and in May 2005, we retained Jefferies    to assist us in exploring our strategic alternatives, including    a potential sale of our wireline telecommunications business    (the “Wireline Business”). On November 4, 2005,    XO Communications, Inc. (“XO”), and XO Holdings, Inc.    (“Seller”), entered into an Equity Purchase Agreement    (“the Equity Purchase Agreement”) that provides for    the sale (the “Wireline Sale”) of the Wireline    Business through the sale of all of the outstanding LLC    interests in XO Communications, LLC, a newly formed,    wholly-owned subsidiary of Seller (“XO LLC”), for an    aggregate purchase price of $700 million in cash. Elk    Associates LLC (“Buyer”), an entity owned by XO's    controlling stockholder, Carl Icahn, executed the Equity    Purchase Agreement to purchase the Wireline Business.

 
    Following the Wireline Sale, Seller will retain the    Company's fixed broadband wireless spectrum assets, cash    and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other    investments, and certain other assets and contingent assets, and    will assume certain liabilities and contingent liabilities,    including amounts due under the Company's secured credit    facility (the “Credit Facility”). The assets and    liabilities of the Wireline Business, including the “XO    Communications” brand name, will be transferred to Buyer.    After the close of the Wireline Sale, the Company will focus its    business on the delivery of broadband, fixed wireless    communications services via its exclusively-licensed Local    Multipoint Distribution Service (“LMDS”) wireless    spectrum. We anticipate operating our Wireless Business under a    new name.
 
    We believe that the Wireline Sale will enable us to take    advantage of the increasing demand for broadband wireless    services, which has been precipitated by customer adoption of    higher bandwidth cellular services such as third generation (3G)    and Evolution Data Only (EV-DO) entertainment and media services    delivered to mobile wireless devices. We believe that now is the    appropriate time to shift the focus of our business model from    our Wireline Business to our Wireless business for the following    reasons:
 
    
    
    

     
        • 
        the costs of purchasing and deploying wireless communications    equipment have declined significantly over the last several    years, and we are now positioned to deploy our fixed wireless    equipment in a more cost-effective manner than our traditional    wireline services;

 

     
        • 
        There is a greater recognition of the need for redundancy in the    technologies included in communications networks;

 

     
        • 
        the increased costs of fiber and copper network facilities due    to FCC rulemaking permitting the ILECs to increase prices for    such facilities is expected to increase the cost of providing    traditional wireline services


 
    Key    Performance Indicators


 
    We use certain key performance indicators (“KPIs”) to    assess operational effectiveness of the business, including:
 
    
    
    

     
        • 
        Gross Margin

 

     
        • 
        Sales, Operating and General Expenses as a Percentage of Revenue

 

     
        • 
        EBITDA

    We believe that EBITDA and gross margin are measures of    operating performance and liquidity that reflect the ongoing    effectiveness of management's sales, cost control, and    acquisition initiatives. EBITDA in 2004 includes a non-cash    goodwill impairment charge of $212.5 million. When    evaluating our financial performance we exclude this charge, and    generally exclude other charges and income that are not directly    attributable to the provision of service to our customers. Sales    operating and general expense is an important measure of the    efficiency with which we sell, provision and support our    services, and the efficiency of our back office operations.
 
    As we continue to develop our Wireless Business, we envision the    KPIs that we use to assess the business will differ from KPIs we    currently use.
