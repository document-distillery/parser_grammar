  PART I


        ITEM 1. 

     BUSINESS


  History



     XL Capital Ltd, together with its subsidiaries (the “Company” or “XL”), is a leading provider of insurance and reinsurance coverages, and financial products and services toindustrial, commercial and professional service firms, insurance companies and other enterprises on a worldwide basis. XL Capital Ltd was incorporated with limited liability under the Cayman Islands Companies Act on March 16, 1998, as EXEL MergerCompany. XL Capital Ltd was formed as a result of the merger of EXEL Limited and Mid Ocean Limited on August 7, 1998, and the Company was named EXEL Limited on that date.

     EXEL Limited and Mid Ocean are companies that were incorporated in the Cayman Islands in 1986 and 1992, respectively. At a special general meeting held on February 1, 1999, the shareholders ofthe Company approved a resolution changing the name of the Company to XL Capital Ltd.

     On June 18, 1999, XL Capital Ltd merged with NAC Re Corp. (“NAC”), a Delaware corporation organized in 1985, in a stock merger. This merger was accounted for as a pooling of interestsunder U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Following the merger, the Company changed its fiscal year end from November 30 to December 31 as a conforming pooling adjustment.

     On July 25, 2001, the Company acquired certain Winterthur International insurance operations (“Winterthur International”) to extend its predominantly North American-based largecorporate insurance business globally. Results of operations of Winterthur International have been included from July 1, 2001, the date from which the economic interest was transferred to the Company.

     Effective January 1, 2002, the Company increased its shareholding in Le Mans RÉ from 49% to 67% in order to expand its international reinsurance operations. On September 3, 2003, theCompany exercised its option to buy the remaining 33% from MMA for approximately $161 million in cash and changed the name of Le Mans RÉ to XL Re Europe. XL Re Europe underwrites a worldwide portfolio comprising most classes of propertyand casualty reinsurance business, together with a select portfolio of life reinsurance business. See further information under Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Item8, Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Segments

     The Company operates through three business segments: Insurance, Reinsurance and Financial Products and Services. These business segments were determined in accordance with Statement ofFinancial Accounting Standard (“FAS”) No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information” (“FAS 131”). General, life and annuity and financial operations are disclosed separately within eachsegment.

     Following changes in certain executive management responsibilities in January 2005, the Company changed the reporting segments under which certain business units are reported in order toreflect these changes in responsibilities.

     The following areas have been changed for all periods presented:

Results of business structured by XL Financial Solutions Ltd (“XLFS”) are now included entirely within
 the Financial Products and Services segment whereas previously this unit wasreported in all three segments, depending on the nature of individual contracts.

Certain blocks of U.S.-based term life mortality reinsurance business previously included in the Financial
 Products and Services segment are now included in the Reinsurance segment asmanagement of these contracts was transferred to the life reinsurance business units in order to centralize the Company's management of traditional mortality-basedreinsurance business.


1


Political risk insurance business units now report to executive management of the Financial Products and
 Services segment and, as such, future earnings from this business are no longerreported in the Insurance
 segment but included with financial operations.

All operations of business units within the Financial Products and Services segment, including guaranteed
 investment contracts and funding agreements, are now reported under financialoperations in order to consolidate businesses with similar operating characteristics and risks.

All net investment income and net income from affiliates generated by assets and interest expense incurred
 on liabilities of the business units within the Financial Products and Servicessegment is reported under
 financial operations. This income and expense is included in financial operations as it relates to interest on
 portfolios of separately identified andmanaged assets and deposit liabilities. Management believes this
 change better reflects the nature of spread focused business.


     The following table sets forth an analysis of gross premiums written by segment for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Additional financial information about the Company'ssegments, including financial information about geographic areas, is included in Item 8, Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Insurance Operations


     General


     The Company provides commercial property and casualty insurance products on a global basis. Products generally provide tailored coverages for complex corporate risks and are divided into twocategories: risk management products and specialty lines products.

     Risk management products comprise global property and casualty insurance programs for large multinational companies and institutions and include umbrella liability, product recall, U.S.workers' compensation, property catastrophe and primary master property and liability coverages. Risk management products generally provide large capacity on a primary, quota share or excess of loss basis. Risk management products are targetedto large worldwide companies in major industry groups including aerospace, automotive, consumer products, pharmaceutical, pulp and paper, high technology, telecommunications, transportation and basic metals. In North America, casualty businesswritten is generally long-tail, umbrella and high layer excess business, meaning that the Company's liability attaches after large deductibles, including self insurance or insurance from other companies. Primary casualty programs (includingworkers' compensation) generally require customers to take large deductibles or self-insured retentions. Outside of North America, casualty business is also written on a primary basis. Policies are written on an occurrence, claims-made andoccurrence reported basis. The Company's property business written is short-tail by nature and written on both a primary and excess of loss basis. Property business written includes exposures to man-made and natural disasters, and generally,loss experience is characterized as low frequency and high severity. This may result in volatility in the Company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. See Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis ofFinancial Condition and Results of Operations.”

     Specialty lines products include professional liability insurance, environmental liability insurance, aviation and satellite insurance, marine and offshore energy insurance, equine, and otherinsurance coverages including program business.

     Professional liability insurance includes directors' and officers' liability, errors and omissions liability and employment practices liability coverages. Policies are written on botha primary and excess of loss basis. Directors' and officers' coverage includes primary and excess directors' and officers' liability, employment practices liability, company securities and private company directors' andofficers' liability. Products are targeted at a variety of different sized companies, with a heavy concentration on small to medium-sized firms when written on a primary basis. Employment practices liability is written primarily for very largecorporations and covers those firms for legal liability in regard to the treatment of employees. Errors and omissions coverage is written on a primary and excess basis. Errors and omissions insurance written on a primary basis is targeted to smallto medium-sized firms and coverage is provided for various professional exposures, including, but not limited to, insurance brokers, consultants, architects and engineers, lawyers and real estate agents.

     Environmental liability products include pollution and remediation legal liability, general and project-specific pollution and professional liability, commercial general property redevelopmentand contractor's pollution liability. Business is written for both single and multiple years on a primary or excess of loss, claims-made or, less frequently, occurrence basis. Targeted industries include chemical facilities, environmentalservice firms, contractors, healthcare facilities, manufacturing facilities, real estate redevelopment, transportation and construction. The Company also offers commercial general liability and automobile liability insurance to environmentalbusinesses.

     Aviation and satellite products include comprehensive airline hull and liability, airport liability, aviation manufacturers' product liability, aviation ground handler liability, largeaircraft hull and liability, corporate non-owned aircraft liability, space third party liability and satellite risk including damage or malfunction during ascent to orbit and continual operation, and aviation war. Aviation liability and physicaldamage coverage is offered for large aviation risks on a proportional basis, while smaller general aviation risks are offered on a primary basis. Satellite risks are generally written on a proportional basis. The target markets for aviation andsatellite products include airlines, aviation product manufacturers, aircraft service firms, general aviation operators and telecommunications firms.

     Marine and offshore energy and equine insurance are also provided by the Company. Marine and energy coverage includes marine hull and machinery, marine war, marine excess liability, cargo andoffshore energy insurance. Equine products specialize in providing bloodstock, livestock and fish farm insurance.

     The Company exited the surety business in mid-2005. Prior to that time, business was written on a broad range of surety products and services throughout North America, with a focus on contract,commercial and international trade surety bonds, targeting all segments of the construction marketplace. Surety products included bid, performance, payment, maintenance and supply bonds, commercial surety bonds, U.S. customs and international tradesurety bonds, license bonds, permit bonds, court bonds, public official bonds and other miscellaneous bonds.

     The Company's program business specializes in insurance coverages for distinct market segments in North America, including program administrators and managing general agents who operate ina specialized market niche and have unique industry backgrounds or specialized underwriting capabilities. Products encompass automobile extended warranty, intellectual property and trademark infringement, small commercial property catastrophe andother property and casualty coverage.

     The excess nature of many of the Company's insurance products, coupled with historically large policy limits, results in a book of business that can have losses characterized as lowfrequency and high severity. As a result, large losses, though infrequent, can have a significant impact on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The Company attempts to mitigate this risk by, among otherthings, using strict underwriting guidelines and various reinsurance arrangements, discussed below.

     U.S. Terrorism

     The U.S. Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as amended, (“TRIA”) became effective on November 26, 2002 and was a three-year federal program effective through 2005. On December 22,2005, President George Bush

3


signed a bill extending TRIA for two more years, continuing the program through 2007. TRIA voided in force terrorism exclusions as of November 26, 2002 for certified terrorism acts (i.e., those arising from international,not domestic acts) on all TRIA specified property and casualty business. TRIA requires covered insurers to make coverage available for certified acts of terrorism on all new and renewal policies issued after TRIA was enacted. TRIA allows the Companyto assess a premium charge for terrorism coverage and, if the policyholder declines the coverage or fails to pay the buy-back premium, certified acts of terrorism may then be excluded from the policy, subject, however, to state specificrequirements. Terrorism coverage cannot be excluded from workers' compensation policies. Subject to a premium-based deductible and provided that the Company has otherwise complied with all the requirements as specified in TRIA, for each yearthis program is in effect, the Company is eligible for reimbursement by the Federal Government for up to 90% of its covered terrorism-related losses arising from a certified terrorist attack in 2005 and 2006, and up to 85% of such losses in 2007.Such payment by the government will, in effect, provide reinsurance protection on a quota share basis (with the government absorbing 90%, 90% and 85% of the loss and the applicable insurance company absorbing the remaining 10%, 10% and 15% in 2005,2006 and 2007, respectively). Entitlement to such reimbursement ends once the aggregated insured losses for the entire insurance industry exceed $100 billion in a single program year. Once this $100 billion loss threshold has been reachedfor any program year, any insurer covered under TRIA that has met its deductible will not be responsible for any further loss payments in that program year.

     The Company had, prior to the passage of TRIA, underwritten exposures under certain insurance policies that included coverage for terrorism. The passage of TRIA has required the Company to makea mandatory offer of “Certified” terrorism coverage with respect to all of its TRIA covered insurance policies. In addition, the Company underwrites a number of policies providing terrorism coverage that are not subject to TRIA.

     Non-U.S. Terrorism

     The Company provides coverage for terrorism under casualty policies on a case-by-case basis, except with respect to workers' compensation policies on which no terrorism exclusion of anytype is permitted. However, the Company generally does not provide significant limits of coverage for terrorism under first party property policies outside of the U.S. unless required to do so by local law, or as required to comply with any nationalterrorism risk pool which may be available. Various countries have enacted legislation to provide insurance coverage for terrorism occurring within their borders, to protect registered property, and to protect citizens traveling abroad. Thelegislation typically requires registered direct insurers to provide terrorism coverage for specified coverage lines and then permits them to cede the risk to a national risk pool. The Company has subsidiaries that participate in terrorism riskpools in various jurisdictions, including Australia, France, Spain, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom.

     Underwriting

     The Company underwrites and prices most risks individually following a review of the exposure and in accordance with the Company's underwriting guidelines. Most of the Company'sinsurance operations have underwriting guidelines that are industry-specific. The Company seeks to control its exposure on an individual insurance contract through terms and conditions, policy limits and sublimits, attachment points, and facultativeand treaty reinsurance arrangements on certain types of risks.

     The Company's underwriters generally evaluate each industry category and subgroups within each category. Premiums are set and adjusted for an insured based, in large part, on the industrygroup in which the insured is placed and the insured's perceived risk relative to the other risks in that group. Rates may vary significantly according to the industry group of the insured as well as the insured's risk relative to thegroup. The Company's rating methodology for individual insureds seeks to set premiums in accordance with claims potential as measured by past experience and future expectations, the attachment point and amount of underlying insurance, thenature and scope of the insured's operations, including the industry group in which the insured operates, exposures to loss, natural hazard exposures,

4


risk management quality and other specific risk factors relevant in the judgment of the Company's underwriters to the type of business being written.

     Underwriting and loss experience is reviewed regularly for, among other things, loss trends, emerging exposures, changes in the regulatory or legal environment as well as the efficacy of policyterms and conditions.

     As the Company's insurance products are primarily specialized coverages, underwriting guidelines and policy forms differ by product offering as well as by legal jurisdiction. Liabilityinsurance is written on both a primary and excess of loss basis, on occurrence, occurrence reported and claims-made policy forms. Occurrence reported policies typically cover occurrences causing unexpected and unintended personal injury or propertydamage to third parties arising from events or conditions that commence at or subsequent to an inception date, or retroactive date, if applicable (but not prior to January 1, 1986), and prior to the expiration of the policy provided that propernotice is given during the term of the policy or the discovery period. Traditional occurrence coverage is also available for restricted classes of risk and is generally written on a follow-form basis where the policy adopts the terms, conditions andexclusions of the underlying policy. Property insurance risks are written on a lead or follow-form basis that usually provides coverage for all risks of physical damage and business interruption. Maximum limits are generally subject to sublimits forcoverage in critical earthquake zones, where the Company seeks to limit its liability in these areas.

     Reinsurance Ceded

     In certain cases, the risks assumed by the Company in the insurance segment are partially reinsured with third party reinsurers. Reinsurance ceded varies by location and line of business basedon a number of factors, including market conditions. The benefits of ceding risks to third party reinsurers include reducing exposure on individual risks, protecting against catastrophic risks, maintaining acceptable capital ratios and enabling thewriting of additional business. Reinsurance ceded does not legally discharge the Company from its liabilities to the original policyholder in respect of the risk being reinsured.

     The Company uses reinsurance to support the underwriting and retention guidelines of each of its subsidiaries as well as to control the aggregate exposure of the Company to a particular risk orclass of risks. Reinsurance is purchased at several levels ranging from reinsurance of risks assumed on individual contracts to reinsurance covering the aggregate exposure on a portfolio of policies issued by groups of companies. See Item 7,“Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

     Premiums

     Premium rates and underwriting terms and conditions for all lines of business written vary by jurisdiction principally due to local market conditions, competitor product offerings and legalrequirements.

     North America - AIG, ACE, Chubb, FMG, Zurich, St. Paul/Travelers, CNA Financial Corporation, Hartford, Factory Mutual Insurance Company, Liberty Mutual Group and Lloyd's.

     Europe - Allianz Aktiengesellschaft, AIG, FMG, Zurich, AXA, Munich Re, ACE, Lloyd's, Swiss Re and Allgemeine Versicherungs-AG.

     Bermuda - ACE, Allied World Assurance Company, Axis Capital Group, Max Re Ltd., Endurance Specialty Insurance Ltd (“Endurance”), Arch Capital Group Ltd and Starr Excess LiabilityInsurance Co Ltd.

     See Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -Executive Overview” for further discussion.

     Marketing and Distribution

     Clients (insureds) are referred to the Company through a large number of international, national and regional brokers, acting as their agents, and captive managers who receive from the insuredor ceding company a set fee or brokerage commission usually equal to a percentage of gross premiums. In the past, the Company has also entered into contingent commission arrangements with some intermediaries that provide for the payment ofadditional commissions based on such variables as production of new and renewal business or the retention of business. In general, the Company has no implied or explicit commitments to accept business from any particular broker and neither brokersnor any other third party have the authority to bind the Company, except in the case where underwriting authority may be delegated contractually to selected program administrators. Such administrators are subject to a financial and operational duediligence review prior to any such delegation of authority and ongoing reviews and audits are carried out as deemed necessary by the Company with the goal of assuring the continuing integrity of underwriting and related business operations. See Item8, Note 18(a) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the Company's major brokers.

     Claims Administration

     Claims management for the insurance operations includes the review of initial loss reports, administration of claims databases, generation of appropriate responses to claims reports,identification and handling of coverage issues, determination of whether further investigation is required and, where appropriate, retention of claims counsel, establishment of case reserves, payment of claims and notification to reinsurers. Withrespect to the establishment of case reserves, when the Company is notified of insured losses, claims personnel record a case reserve as appropriate for the estimated amount of the exposure at that time. The estimate reflects the judgment of claimspersonnel based on general reserving practices, the experience and knowledge of such personnel regarding the nature of the specific claim

6


and, where appropriate, advice of counsel. Reserves are also established to provide for the estimated expense of settling claims, including legal and other fees and the general expenses of administering the claimsadjustment process.

     Claims in respect of business written by the Company's Lloyd's syndicates are primarily notified by various central market bureaus. Where a syndicate is a “leading”syndicate on a Lloyd's policy, its underwriters and claims adjusters will deal with the broker or insured on behalf of itself and the following market for any particular claim. This may involve appointing attorneys or loss adjusters. The claimsbureaux and the leading syndicate advise movement in loss reserves to all syndicates participating on the risk. The Company's claims department may adjust the case reserves it records from those advised by the bureaux as deemednecessary.

     Certain of the Company's product lines have arrangements with third party administrators (“TPAs”) to provide claims handling services to the Company in respect of such productlines. These agreements set forth the duties of the TPA, limits of authority and various procedures that are required. These arrangements are also subject to audit review by the Company's claim departments.

Reinsurance Operations


     General


     The Company provides casualty, property, property catastrophe, marine, aviation, accident and health, and other specialty reinsurance and life and annuity products on a global basis withbusiness being written on both a proportional and non-proportional basis. Business written on a non-proportional basis generally provides for an indemnification by the Company of the ceding company for a portion of the losses on policies in excessof a specified loss amount. For business written on a proportional or “quota share” basis, the Company receives an agreed percentage of the premium and is liable for the same percentage of the incurred losses. The ceding company receives acommission based upon premiums ceded and may also, under certain circumstances, receive a profit commission. Reinsurance may be written on a treaty or facultative basis.

     The Company's casualty reinsurance includes general liability, professional liability, automobile and workers' compensation. Professional liability includes directors' andofficers', employment practices, medical malpractice, and environmental liability. Casualty lines are written as treaties or programs on both a proportional and a non-proportional basis as well as individual risk business written on afacultative basis. The treaty business includes clash programs which cover a number of underlying policies involved in one occurrence or a judgment above an underlying policy's limit, before suffering a loss. The treaty business is mainlywritten using reinsurance intermediaries while the individual risk business is generally sold directly to the ceding companies.

     The Company's property business, primarily short-tail in nature, is written on both a treaty and facultative basis and includes property catastrophe, property excess of loss and propertyproportional. A significant portion of the property business underwritten consists of large aggregate exposures to man-made and natural disasters and, generally, loss experience is characterized as low frequency and high severity. This may result involatility in the Company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. See Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

     The Company seeks to manage its reinsurance exposures to catastrophic events by limiting the amount of exposure in each geographic or peril zone worldwide, underwriting in excess of varyingattachment points and requiring that its property catastrophe contracts provide for aggregate limits. The Company also seeks to protect its aggregate exposures by peril and zone through the purchase of reinsurance programs. See “- RiskManagement” for further information.

     The Company's property catastrophe reinsurance account is generally “all risk” in nature. As a result, the Company is exposed to losses from sources as diverse as hurricanes andother windstorms, earthquakes, freezing, riots, floods, industrial explosions, fires, and many other potential disasters. In accordance with market practice, the Company's policies generally exclude certain risks such as war, nuclearcontamination or radiation. Following the 

7


terrorist attacks at the World Trade Center in New York City, in Washington, D.C. and in Pennsylvania on September 11, 2001 (collectively, “the September 11 event”), terrorism cover, including nuclear, biologicaland chemical, has also been excluded in many territories and classes. The Company's predominant exposure under such coverage is to property damage.

     Property catastrophe reinsurance provides coverage on an excess of loss basis when aggregate losses and loss adjustment expenses from a single occurrence of a covered event exceed theattachment point specified in the policy. Some of the Company's property catastrophe contracts limit coverage to one occurrence in any single policy year, but most contracts generally enable one reinstatement to be purchased by thereinsured.

     The Company also writes property risk excess of loss reinsurance. Property risk excess of loss reinsurance covers a loss to the reinsured on a single risk of the type reinsured rather than toaggregate losses for all covered risks on a specific peril, as is the case with catastrophe reinsurance. The Company's property proportional account includes reinsurance of direct property insurance. The Company seeks to limit the catastropheexposure from its proportional and per risk excess business through extensive use of occurrence and cession limits.

     Other specialty reinsurance products include energy, fidelity, trade credit and political risk.

     The Company had, prior to the passing of TRIA, underwritten reinsurance exposures in the U.S. that included terrorism coverage. Since the passage of TRIA in the U.S., the Company hasunderwritten a very limited number of stand-alone terrorism coverage policies in addition to coverage included within non-stand-alone policies. In the U.S., in addition to nuclear, biological and chemical (“NBC”) acts, the Companygenerally excludes coverage included under TRIA from the main catastrophe exposed policies. In other cases, both within and outside the U.S., the Company generally relies on either a terrorism exclusion clause, which does not include personal lines,excluding NBC, or a similar clause that excludes terrorism completely. There are a limited number of classes underwritten where no terrorism exclusion exists.

     The Company's accident and health products include accidental death, medical, hospital indemnity and income protection coverage.

     The Company underwrites a small portfolio of contracts covering political risk and trade credit. Exposure is assumed from a limited number of trade credit contracts and through Lloyd'squota shares. In addition, there are runoff exposures from discontinued writings in the Company's marine portfolio.

     Life and Annuity

     The Company's reinsurance segment also currently includes life reinsurance primarily in respect of European lives, and is developing a U.S. platform. This includes term assurances, grouplife, critical illness cover, immediate annuities and disability income business. The majority of the business written is on a proportional basis. The Company has also written a few large contracts comprising portfolios of closed blocks of U.K. andEuropean annuities. In relation to certain of these contracts, the Company receives cash and investment assets at the inception of the contract relating to future policy benefit reserves assumed. These contracts are long-term in nature where theexpected claims payout period can span thirty to forty years.

     Underwriting

     Underwriting risks for the general and life and annuity reinsurance business are evaluated using a number of factors including, but not limited to, the type and layer of risk to be assumed, theactuarial evaluation of premium adequacy, the cedent's underwriting and claims experience, the cedent's financial condition and claims paying rating, the exposure and/or experience with the cedent, and the line of business to bereinsured.

     Other factors assessed by the Company include the reputation of the proposed cedent, the geographic area in which the cedent does business and its market share, a detailed evaluation ofcatastrophe and risk exposures, and historical loss data for the cedent where available and for the industry as a whole in the relevant regions, in order to

8


compare the cedent's historical loss experience to industry averages. On-site underwriting reviews are performed where it is deemed necessary to determine the quality of a current or prospective cedent'sunderwriting operations, with particular emphasis on proportional and working excess of loss placements.

     For property catastrophe reinsurance business, the Company's underwriting guidelines generally limit the amount of exposure it will directly underwrite for any one reinsured and the amountof the aggregate exposure to catastrophic losses in any one geographic zone. The Company believes that it has defined geographic and peril zones such that a single occurrence, for example an earthquake or hurricane, should not affect more than oneperil zone. While the exposure to multiple zones is considered remote for events such as a hurricane, the Company does manage its aggregate exposures for such a scenario where the Company considers it appropriate to do so. The definition of theCompany's peril zones is subject to periodic review. The Company also generally seeks an attachment point for its property catastrophe reinsurance at a level that is high enough to produce a low frequency of loss. The Company seeks to limit itsaggregate exposure in the proportional business through extensive use of occurrence and cession limits.

     Reinsurance Retroceded

     The Company uses third party reinsurance to support the underwriting and retention guidelines of each reinsurance subsidiary as well as to seek to limit the aggregate exposure of the Company toa particular risk or class of risks. Reinsurance is purchased at several levels ranging from reinsurance of risks assumed on individual contracts to reinsurance covering the aggregate exposures. The benefits of ceding risks to other reinsurersinclude reducing exposure on individual risks, protecting against catastrophic risks, maintaining acceptable capital ratios and enabling the writing of additional business. Reinsurance ceded does not legally discharge the Company from itsliabilities in respect of the risk being reinsured. Reinsurance ceded varies by location and line of business based on factors including, among others, market conditions.

     A full review of the Company's property catastrophe exposures was completed in the spring of 2004 to optimize the economics against the management of such risks. A traditional programincepting between May and July 2004 and renewing annually was put in place to cover these exposures. These covers give protection in various layers and excess of varying attachment points according to territorial exposure. The Company hasco-reinsurance retentions within this program. The program was renewed with June and July 2005 inception dates providing similar amounts of total coverage and an additional structure was purchased with restricted territorial scope with an August2005 inception date.

     A new reinsurance program was purchased incepting at January 2005 to provide additional protection for the Company's marine and offshore energy exposures. These covers provide protectionin various layers and excess of varying attachment points according to the scope of cover provided. The Company has co-reinsurance participations within this program.

     The Company's casualty reinsurance program includes cover for multiple claims arising from three or more risks from a single occurrence or event. This layer was renewed in October 2004 andagain in October 2005 with limits of $25 million excess of $20 million and covers all business written out of the Company's London and Sydney branches as well as XL Re Europe.

     The Company also buys specific reinsurance on its property and aviation portfolios to manage its net exposures in these classes.

     See Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Item 8, Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for furtherinformation.

Company's major brokers. In addition, for life reinsurance operations the majority of business is written directly with the ceding company rather than through a broker.

     Claims Administration

     Claims management for the reinsurance operations includes the receipt of loss notifications, review and approval of claims through a claims approval process, establishment of loss reserves andapproval of loss payments. Case reserves for reported claims are generally established based on reports received from ceding companies with additional case reserves being established when deemed appropriate. Additionally, claims audits are conductedfor specific claims and claims procedures at the offices of selected ceding companies, particularly in the U.S. and U.K.

Financial Products and Services Operations


     General


     Financial Products and Services provides (i) credit protection through the issuance of financial guaranty insurance policies and credit default swaps, as well as the reinsurance thereof, (ii) awide range of structured financial and alternative risk transfer products, (iii) guaranteed investment contracts and funding agreements, (iv) political risk insurance and (v) weather and energy risk management products. Many of the products offeredby the Financial Products and Services segment are unique and tailored to the specific needs of the insured or user.

     Financial guaranty insurance provides an unconditional and irrevocable guaranty to the holder of a debt obligation of full and timely payment of principal and interest. In the event of adefault under the obligation, the insurer has recourse against the issuer and/or any related collateral (which is more common in the case of insured asset-backed obligations or other non-municipal debt) for amounts paid under the terms of thepolicy. Credit default swaps are derivative contracts which offer credit protection relating to a particular security or pools of specified securities. Under the terms of a credit default swap, the seller of credit protection makes a specifiedpayment to the buyer of credit protection upon the occurrence of one or more specified credit events with respect to a referenced security. Credit derivatives typically provide protection to a buyer rather than credit enhancement of an issue as intraditional financial guaranty insurance. The Company's underwriting policies restrict the provision of credit protection to obligations or referenced securities that it determines would be of investment-grade quality without the benefit ofcredit enhancement provided by the Company through the issuance of its insurance policies and credit default swaps. The Company classifies the financial guaranty policies underwritten in four broad categories: asset-backed structured finance, publicfinance obligations, essential infrastructure project finance transactions and future flow obligations. Each category contains risks and structures that are unique to the underlying obligation. Asset-backed obligations insured or reinsured by theCompany are generally issued in structured transactions backed by pools of assets of specified types, such as residential mortgages, auto loans and other consumer receivables, equipment leases and corporate debt obligations, having an ascertainablecash flow or market value. Public finance obligations insured or reinsured consist mainly of general or special obligations of state and local governments, supported by the issuer's ability to charge taxes or fees for specified services orprojects. Essential infrastructure project finance obligations underwritten by the Company include projects such as bridges, toll roads, airports and power plants. Future flow obligations are backed by receivables from the future sales ofcommodities or the processing of payments received by financial institutions.

     Structured financial and alternative risk transfer products cover complex financial risks, including property, casualty, mortality insurance and reinsurance and business enterprise riskmanagement products. Refer to XL Financial Solutions below.

     Guaranteed investment contracts are customized financial products that offer a guaranteed investment return to the purchaser, generally a municipal entity that raises funds for a particularproject and invests such funds pending their drawdown to complete the project. Funding agreements are investment contracts sold to institutional investors. The Company sells funding agreements either directly to qualified institutional buyers or tospecial purpose entities which, in turn, issue medium term notes to fixed income investors. Municipal investment contracts and funding agreements provide users guaranteed rates of interest on amounts deposited with the Company. The Company hasinvestment risk related to its ability to generate sufficient investment income to enable the total invested assets to cover the payment of its estimated ultimate liability on such agreements.

11


     Political risk insurance generally covers risks arising from expropriation, currency inconvertibility, contract frustration, non-payment and war on land or political violence (includingterrorism) in developing regions of the world. Political risk insurance is typically provided to financial institutions, equity investors, exporters, importers, export credit agencies and multilateral agencies in connection with investments andcontracts in emerging market countries. Through December 31, 2005, the majority of such insurance has been written through a managing general agent, Sovereign Risk Insurance Ltd. (“Sovereign”), in which the Company is a joint venturepartner. On January 23, 2006, the Company announced that it would be selling its interest in Sovereign and no longer writing the business produced by it effective February 1, 2006. This transaction is subject to execution of final documentation andregulatory approvals. The in force business written by the Company through January 31, 2006 will be run-off by the Company. The Company's own political risk underwriting team will continue to underwrite such business subsequent to February 1,2006.

     The Company's weather and energy risk management products are customized solutions designed to assist corporate customers, primarily energy companies and utilities, manage their financialexposure to variations in underlying weather conditions and related energy markets. Weather risk management contracts generally average one season (five months) in duration. The Company uses the capital markets to hedge portions of the risks it hasunderwritten. The Company continued to grow its contingent power generator outage insurance business. The outage insurance product protects utilities so that in the event of a generator failure, the cost of purchasing replacement electricity above apreviously established strike price in the power markets is covered. The Company utilizes markets in electricity, but does not actively trade weather or energy derivatives.

     Underwriting

     The Company has underwriting guidelines for the various products and asset classes comprising its credit enhancement business, which include single and aggregate risk limitations on specifiedexposures. A credit committee provides final underwriting approval. The Company's underwriting policy is to credit enhance obligations and exposures that would otherwise be rated in lower investment grade categories. The Company's otheractivities may occasionally structure and underwrite non-investment grade risks.

     For the weather and energy business, the Company has seasonal value at risk (“VaR”) limits for weather and electricity generator outage exposures.

     Individual funding agreements are issued in the context of the overall cash flow structure of the asset/liability portfolio, taking into consideration the impact of each new funding agreementoffering on the overall risk position of the Company.

     With respect to the guaranteed investment contract business, the Company underwrites the cash flow risks associated with each contract and continually monitors each contract's performance.The Company utilizes underwriting guidelines to assess risks and internal cash flow and asset liability models to price each contract. The Company focuses on reinvestment opportunities associated with municipal bond issuers.

     Reinsurance Ceded

     Similar to the Company as a whole, the financial products and services operations utilize outwards reinsurance for single risk and portfolio management purposes. The Company has retrocededrisks on a facultative basis to third party reinsurers to provide greater flexibility to manage large single risks and reduce concentrations in specific bond sectors or geographic regions. For the weather and energy risk management business, theCompany more often uses derivatives rather than reinsurance to hedge or mitigate its primary exposure, but will use reinsurance as well, if deemed appropriate. For the political risk and structured and alternative risk management businesses, theCompany has retroceded certain risks on a facultative basis to reduce overall exposure to large market events.

     Additional discussion and financial information about the financial products and services segment is set forth in Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditionand Results of Operations” and Item 8, Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

     Competition

     The principal competitors in the municipal and asset-backed insured markets include other triple-A rated and, to a lesser extent, double-A rated monoline financial guarantors and multilineinsurance companies and banks. The principal triple-A monoline insurers include MBIA Inc. (“MBIA”), Ambac Financial Group, Inc. (“Ambac”), Financial Guaranty Insurance Company (“FGIC”) and Financial Security AssuranceHoldings Ltd (“FSA”). There are also many means by which issuers may borrow money without using third party credit enhancement. For example, structured financings may be executed by issuing senior and subordinated tranches of debt thateffectively substitute for third party enhancement. Additionally, issuers may raise debt financing by issuing corporate debt or by borrowing from banks. Such alternatives effectively constitute a form of competition for financial guaranty insurancecompanies.

     With respect to the structured and alternative risk management business, competition is encountered from a broad range of multiline reinsurers. Other political risk reinsurers include AIG,Zurich, Chubb and ACE.

     With respect to the Company's weather and energy risk management business, competition is encountered in both the U.S. and on a worldwide basis from companies within the energy, insuranceand, to an increasing extent, the financial services sector. Among the principal competitive factors affecting the Company's weather and energy business are its financial strength ratings, its capability in originating, marketing, structuringand executing innovative products and services, its relative pricing and its ability and willingness to hedge all or a portion of such risks.

     With respect to the Company's guaranteed investment contract business, competitors include financial institutions in the banking, investment banking, life insurance and financial guarantyindustries. These include Aegon, AIG, Bayerische Landesbank (“BLB”), Caisse des Depots et Consignations, FSA and MBIA.

     Marketing and Distribution

     Marketing of the Company's financial guaranty business is targeted based on the type and stage of completion of the transaction. Targeted parties include investment bankers, issuers of andinvestors in credit-enhanced transactions and concessionaires in certain transactions. Other financial guaranty insurers or reinsurers or other counterpar-ties may also be a source of new business, particularly with respect toreinsurance.

     With respect to the Company's weather and energy risk management business, new clients are acquired through direct marketing but may also be referred through a number of brokers whoreceive a fee that is based on the size of the transaction. The Company's main clients are in the energy and financial services sector.

13


     Structured and alternative risk management business is principally originated through specialist intermediaries. Clients are the risk managers for corporations as well as the outwardsreinsurance teams for a range of geographically diverse insurers. Origination for the political risk book is also primarily through specialist brokers while the client base is financial institutions, equity investors, exporters, importers, exportcredit agencies and multilateral agencies.

     The guaranteed investment contract business is mainly originated through specialized brokers. Funding agreements are typically sold through and distributed by investment banks.

     Claims Administration

     Claims management for the financial guaranty business includes the identification of potential claims through systematic surveillance of the insured portfolio, the establishment of reserves forlosses that are both probable and estimable, the accounting for loss adjustment expenses, the receipt of claims, the approval of claim payments and the notification to reinsurers. Surveillance also involves proactive efforts to prevent or mitigatepotential claims once they are identified. If a claim is paid, recoveries will be sought based on the security pledged under the policy.

     With respect to the Company's weather and energy business, claims management includes the identification of potential claims through review of underlying weather conditions and unitoutages within the insured portfolio, the establishment of reserves for losses that are probable and estimable, loss adjustment expenses, the receipt of claims, the approval of claim payments and the notification of claims to reinsurers.

     The majority of the claims management of the political risk business has been handled by Sovereign, with the balance administered internally using the same guidelines as detailed within theInsurance segment operations.

     Claims administration and notification for structured and alternative risk business is principally handled by third party administrators, and claims are settled following a review of the claimdetail and verification of its validity.

     XL Financial Solutions

     Structured financial and alternative risk transfer products are structured and managed through the Company's financial solutions operations (“XLFS”). XLFS structures a wide rangeof structured financial products and alternative risk transfer transactions, including property and casualty insurance and reinsurance, asset backed securitizations and market risk management transactions. Most transactions originated through XLFShave multi-year exposures, with many transactions having durations in excess of ten years.

Geographic Areas

     See Item 8, Notes 3 and 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Risk Management

     The Company seeks to manage all of its risks on an enterprise wide basis. The Company's senior management takes an active role in the enterprise risk management process and has developedand implemented policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and management of all current and emerging risks pertaining to the Company's activities includingmarket, credit, underwriting, operational and legal risks. The Company has a Risk Management Committee which in conjunction with the Executive Management Board, acts to ensure major risks are being managed with an “enterprise wide”perspective. Due to the changing nature of the risk landscape and global marketplace, the Company's risk management policies, procedures and methodologies are constantly evolving and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Seniormanagement provides regular updates on major risk exposures to the Finance and Audit Committee's of the Board of Directors. See Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” for further discussion.

     Aggregate exposures to potential catastrophic events, including natural catastrophes are managed at an entity level and also at the corporate level. In addition to internal controls designed tomitigate the Company's exposure to a

14


specific event or class of business, the Company maintains various reinsurance programs that help protect the Company against foreseeable catastrophic and other types of risks.

     Under its reinsurance security policy, the Company seeks to cede business to reinsurers generally rated “A” or better by Standard & Poor's, a division of The McGraw-HillCompanies, Inc. (“S&P”), or, in the case of Lloyd's syndicates, “B+” from Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody's”). The Company's Chief Risk Officer considers reinsurers that are not rated ordo not fall within the above rating categories and may grant exceptions to the Company's general policy on a case-by-case basis. See Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”and Item 8, Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

     As part of risk management, the Company also has several credit committees and underwriting/transaction committees that meet regularly to review the terms and conditions of certain proposed newtransactions.

Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses

     Certain aspects of the Company's business have loss experience characterized as low frequency and high severity. This may result in volatility in the Company's results of operations,financial condition and liquidity.

     Loss reserves are established due to the significant periods of time that may lapse between the occurrence, reporting and payment of a loss. To recognize liabilities for unpaid losses and lossexpenses, the Company estimates future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events. The Company's reserving practices and the establishment of any particular reserve reflect management's judgmentconcerning sound financial practice and do not represent any admission of liability with respect to any claim. Unpaid losses and loss expense reserves are established for reported claims (“case reserves”) and incurred but not reported(“IBNR”) claims.

     The nature of the Company's high excess of loss liability and catastrophe business can result in loss payments that are both irregular and significant. Similarly, adjustments to reservesfor individual years can be irregular and significant. Such adjustments are part of the normal course of business for the Company. Conditions and trends that have affected development of liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur in thefuture. Accordingly, it is inappropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based upon historical experience. See generally, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”

     The tables below present the development of unpaid losses and loss expense reserves related to the Company's general and financial operations on both a net and gross basis. The cumulativeredundancy (deficiency) calculated on a net basis differs from that calculated on a gross basis. As different reinsurance programs cover different underwriting years, net and gross loss experience will not develop proportionately. The top line ofthe tables shows the estimated liability, net of reinsurance recoveries, as at the year end balance sheet date for each of the indicated years. This represents the estimated amounts of losses and loss expenses, including IBNR, arising in the currentand all prior years that are unpaid at the year end balance sheet date of the indicated year. The tables show the re-estimated amount of the previously recorded reserve liability based on experience as of the year end balance sheet date of eachsucceeding year. The estimate changes as more information becomes known about the frequency and severity of claims for individual years. The cumulative redundancy (deficiency) represents the aggregate change with respect to that liability originallyestimated. The lower portion of the first table also reflects the cumulative paid losses relating to these reserves. Conditions and trends that have affected development of liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur in the future.Accordingly, it may not be appropriate to extrapolate redundancies or deficiencies into the future, based on the tables below. See Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”

Current year net losses incurred

     Current year net losses incurred in 2005 increased from 2004 due primarily to the impact of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma being greater than that of the 2004 Atlantic hurricanes. There wasa relatively low level of catastrophic events affecting the Company in 2003.

     Collectively, Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Wilma and other smaller natural catastrophes in the third and fourth quarters of 2005 have had a substantial impact on the results of the Company for theyear ended December 31, 2005. The Company has estimated losses incurred, net of reinsurance recoveries, of $1.27 billion, $357.9 million, $247.1 and $96.0 million related to Hurricane Katrina, Rita, Wilma, and the combined impact ofthe other catastrophes, respectively, based on preliminary reports and estimates to loss and damage.

     The 2004 Atlantic hurricane season resulted in four insured hurricane losses aggregating to what was at the time the largest seasonal loss in history and had a substantial impact on the resultsof the Company for that year. For the four hurricane losses, the Company incurred in 2004 net losses of $516.6 million, net of reinsurance recoverables.

     As different reinsurance programs cover different underwriting years, contracts and lines of business, net and gross loss experience do not develop proportionately. In particular, gross adversedevelopment in 2004 related primarily to the acquired Winterthur International insurance operations (the “Winterthur Business”), which was reinsured through the post closing protection referred to below.

     Prior years net adverse development in 2005 was impacted by the unfavorable conclusion of the independent actuarial process with Winterthur Swiss Insurance Company, as $834.2 million ofreinsurance recoverables related to post closing protection on the acquired Winterthur Business were rendered uncollectible. In addition the Company incurred higher than expected development relating to U.S. casualty and professional reinsurancebusinesses of $267.0 million and excess professional liability insurance lines of business of $259.5 million. Partially offsetting this adverse development were releases of $211.6 million in reinsurance and insurance property lines ofbusiness globally and to a lesser degree casualty insurance business written on the Company's European Global Risk platform.

     Prior years net adverse development in 2004, related primarily to increases in reported insurancecase reserves for excess professional liability, excess casualty and specialty lines.

     See Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Item 8, Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for furtherinformation regarding the developments in prior year loss reserve estimates for each of the years indicated within each of the Company's operating segments.

Net loss reserves acquired


There were no net loss reserves acquired in 2005 or 2004.

18


     Net loss reserves acquired in 2003 of $199.2 million included $85.2 million related to the Company's Lloyd's operation in connection with the closure of the Lloyd's 2000underwriting year where reserves and cash were transferred to the Company's Lloyd's Syndicates. The Company did not provide 100% of the Syndicate capacity for the 2000 underwriting year. In addition, $114.0 million related to thesettlement of the purchase price in December 2003 for the acquisition of certain Winterthur International insurance operations. In connection with the settlement, the Company updated the fair value of the net assets acquired as of this date and reduced theestimated amount of unpaid losses recoverable from the Winterthur Swiss Insurance Company (“WSIC”) under the Sale and Purchase Agreement, as amended, between XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd and WSIC. For further information see Item 8, Note5(b) to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Exchange rate effects

     Exchange rate effects on net loss reserves in each of the three years ended December 31, 2005 related to the global operations of the Company where several operations have a functional currencythat is not the U.S. dollar. The increase in the value of the U.S. dollar in 2005 and the reduction in the value of the U.S. dollar during the two preceding years mainly compared to the Swiss franc, U.K. sterling and the Euro has given rise totranslation and revaluation exchange movements of $(375.7) million, $309.8 million and $394.1 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Net paid losses

     Total net paid losses were $2.6 billion in 2005 and $3.1 billion and $2.9 billion in 2004 and 2003, respectively. For 2005, the decrease in net paid losses over 2004 relatesprimarily to the recovery from Winterthur Swiss Insurance Company upon conclusion of the independent actuarial process, partially offset by payments for catastrophes in both 2004 and 2005. The increase in net paid losses in 2004 relates to both theincrease in business over the last several years and the payments associated with the 2004 Atlantic hurricane losses. See further information under Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results ofOperations.”

Other loss related information

     The Company's net incurred losses and loss expenses include actual and estimates of potential non-recoveries from reinsurers. As at December 31, 2005 and 2004, the reserve for potentialnon-recoveries from reinsurers was $234.3 million and $280.7 million, respectively.

     Except for certain workers' compensation and long-term disability liabilities, the Company does not discount its unpaid losses and loss expenses. The Company utilizes tabular reserving forworkers' compensation and long-term disability unpaid losses that are considered fixed and determinable, and discounts such losses using an interest rate of 5% (2004: 5%). The Company decreased the interest rate in 2003 from 7% to 5%.The effect of the decrease in the interest rate resulted in an increase in loss reserves of approximately $35.0 million in 2003. The tabular reserving methodology results in applyinguniform and consistent criteria for establishing expected future indemnity and medical payments (including an explicit factor for inflation) and the use of mortality tables to determine expected payment periods. Tabular unpaid losses and lossexpenses, net of reinsurance, at December 31, 2005 and 2004 were $716.7 million and $578.6 million, respectively. The related discounted unpaid losses and loss expenses were $322.2 million and $290.0 million as of December 31, 2005and 2004, respectively.

Investments


Investment structure and strategy


     The Company's investment operations are managed centrally by the Company's investment department, which also provides certain investment advice and support for the rest of theCompany's operations. The Finance Committee

19


of the Board of Directors approves the Company's overall investment policy and guidelines and reviews the implementation of the investment strategy on a regular basis.

     The primary objectives of the investment strategy are to support the liabilities arising from the operations of the Company, generate stable investment income and build book value for theCompany over the longer term. The strategy strives to maximize investment returns while taking into account market and credit risk. Market risk is due to interest rate variability and exposure to foreign denominated currencies, which the Companyseeks to manage through asset/liability management, and due to the allocation to risk assets, including global equity securities, which the Company seeks to manage through diversification. Credit risk arises from investments in fixed incomesecurities and is managed with aggregate and portfolio limits.

     The Company's overall investment portfolio is structured to take into account a number of variables including local regulatory requirements, business needs, collateral management and risktolerance. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, total investments, cash and cash equivalents and accrued investment income, less net payable for investments purchased, was $41.6 billion and $32.4 billion, respectively.

     Functionally, the Company's investment portfolio is divided into four principal components. The largest component is the general account asset/liability portfolio supporting property andcasualty and financial guaranty liabilities, which was approximately $23.7 billion and $18.4 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The key focus for this component is asset and liability management and it is used to provideliquidity to settle claims arising from the Company's general and financial operations. The asset/liability portfolio is made up entirely of investment grade fixed income securities.

     The second component of the investment portfolio is the structured and spread product portfolio, which was approximately $13.7 billion and $9.7 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004,respectively. This portfolio consists of highly structured actively managed investment portfolios that support specific insurance and reinsurance transactions, 
e.g.

, depositliability and future policy benefit reserves. Many of these transactions have underlying liabilities that pay out over many years. As a result, asset and liability management is also a key focus for this portfolio.

     The third component of the investment portfolio is the risk asset portfolio, which was approximately $3.8 billion and $3.9 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. TheCompany utilizes a risk budgeting framework for the dynamic risk and asset allocation of the risk asset portfolio. The risk asset portfolio is that portion of the Company's surplus that is invested in risk assets to generate growth in theCompany's book value over the longer term with the efficient utilization of risk. The fundamental premise of the risk budgeting methodology for the risk asset portfolio is to maximize expected returns for a given level of risk. The risk assetportfolio currently includes four core diversified total return strategy portfolios incorporating: (i) alternative investment strategies; (ii) high yield fixed income; (iii) public equities; and (iv) private investments, which include private equityand mezzanine funds and non-rated tranches of collateralized debt obligations.

     The Company sets specific constraints during the risk allocation process that reflect the Company's overall tolerance for risk, including guidelines on the level of VaR of the risk assetportfolio, stress testing and a maximum drawdown level attributable to the alternative investment portfolio. These levels are approved by the Finance Committee of the Company's Board of Directors annually. In addition, each of the core riskasset portfolios is subject to specific investment guidelines that are also approved by the Finance Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. These guidelines address the investment parameters and risk associated with each portfolio. TheCompany monitors the total risk and return of the risk asset portfolio and the four strategy portfolios to ensure compliance with the risk target guidelines as approved.

     The alternative investment portfolio, part of the risk asset portfolio, is a highly diversified portfolio of investments in limited partnerships and similar investment vehicles, with each fundgenerally pursuing absolute return investment mandates. These are typically investing in one or more of the traditional asset classes including equities, fixed income, credit, currency and commodity markets, and similar investment vehicles. For themajority of the portfolio, the Company owns minority investment interests that are accounted for under the equity method and are

included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet under “Investments in affiliates.” The investment objective of the alternative investment portfolio is to attain a high risk-adjusted total return while maintaining amoderate to low level of sensitivity to the movements in traditional asset classes and realizing a low volatility. This portfolio was $1.7 billion and $1.7 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004.

     The fourth component of the Company's total investment portfolio, valued at $0.4 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004, is related to insurance and financial affiliates and investmentsin investment management companies. At December 31, 2005, the Company owned minority stakes in eight independent investment management companies. These ownership stakes are part of the Company's asset management strategy, pursuant to which theCompany seeks to develop relationships with specialty investment management organizations, generally acquiring an equity interest in the business. In these investments, the Company seeks to achieve strong returns on capital while accessing theinvestment expertise of professionals to help manage portions of the Company's investment assets. In addition, the Company is active in the relationships with these managers, seeking to benefit from the intellectual capital in ways that willenhance the Company's overall financial performance and achieve broader strategic goals.

     Where the Company maintains significant influence over the decisions of the investment management organization, through board representation or through certain voting and/or consent rights, theCompany's proportionate share of the income or loss from these companies is reported as net income from operating affiliates. The Company's existing managers manage or sponsor a broad range of investment products, providing institutionaland high net worth investors access to a wide array of asset classes and investment strategies. It is a strategic objective of the Company to continue to expand the diversification of investment products offered by its affiliates by assistingexisting affiliates in launching new products and new lines of business as well as by making additional ownership investments in other specialty asset managers. See Item 8, Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Implementation of investment strategy

     Although the Company's investment department is responsible for implementation of the investment strategy, the day-to-day management of the investment portfolio is outsourced to investmentmanagement service providers. External investment managers are selected and monitored using a disciplined due diligence process. Each investment manager may manage one or more portfolios and is governed by a detailed set of investment guidelines,including overall objectives, risk parameters, and diversification requirements that fall within the overall guidelines discussed above. Compliance with investment guidelines is monitored on a regular basis by the investment department.

Investment performance

     See Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for discussion of the Company's investment performance.

Credit ratings, duration and maturity profile

     It is the Company's policy to operate the aggregate fixed income portfolio with a minimum weighted average credit rating of “Aa3/AA-.” The aggregate credit rating is determinedbased on the market value weighted average credit rating using a linear credit rating scale similar to that used by Moody's. The highest credit rated fixed income securities are held within the asset/liability and structured product portfolios.Sub-investment grade (high yield) fixed income securities are held within the risk asset portfolio. The weighted average credit rating of the fixed income portfolio was “Aa2/AA” at December 31, 2005 and 2004.

     The Company did not have an aggregate investment in a single entity, other than the U.S. Government, in excess of 10% of shareholders' equity at December 31, 2005 or 2004.

     The aggregate duration of the fixed income portfolio is managed relative to liabilities. Duration measures bond price volatility and is an indicator of the sensitivity of the price of a bond(or a portfolio of bonds) to changes in interest rates, assuming a parallel change in the yield curve reflecting the percentage change in price for a 100 basis point change in yield. Management believes that the duration of the fixed incomeportfolio is the best single measure of interest rate risk and the table below summarizes the weighted average duration in years of the main components of the fixed income portfolio at December 31, 2005 and 2004:

     The maturity profile of the fixed income portfolio is a function of the maturity profile of liabilities and, to a lesser extent, the maturity profile of common fixed income benchmarks. Forfurther information on the maturity profile of the fixed income portfolio see Item 8, Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Ratings

     The Company's ability to underwrite business is dependent upon the quality of its claims paying and financial strength ratings as evaluated by independent agencies.

     In March of 2006, Fitch upgraded the long-term debt ratings for XL Capital Ltd and XL Capital Finance (Europe) plc to “A” from “A-”. The outlooks remain stable.

     In the fourth quarter of 2005, Standard & Poor's, lowered the Company's core property and casualty operating companies' financial strength ratings to “A+” from“AA-” and affirmed them with a stable outlook. During this period, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. also lowered the insurance financial strength ratings of the Company's leading insurance operating subsidiaries to “Aa3”from “Aa2” and confirmed the insurance financial strength ratings of its leading reinsurance operating subsidiaries at “Aa3”. In October 2005, Fitch Ratings Inc. lowered the insurance financial strength ratings ofthe Company's lead insurance and reinsurance operating subsidiaries to “AA-” from “AA.” A.M. Best Company, Inc. affirmed the Company's financial strength rating of “A+” and its operatingsubsidiaries' issuer credit ratings of “aa-” in December 2005. The Company subsequently raised $3.2 billion through the issuance of ordinary shares and equity security units.

     In addition, XL Capital Ltd currently has the following long term debt ratings: “a-” (stable) from A.M. Best, “A-” (stable) from Standard and Poor's, “A3”(stable) from Moody's and “A-” (stable) from Fitch.

     The Company believes that the primary users of ratings include commercial and investment banks, policyhold-ers, brokers, ceding companies and investors.

Tax Matters

     See Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Item 8, Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Regulation

     The Company's operations are subject to regulation and supervision in each of the jurisdictions where they are domiciled and licensed to conduct business. Generally, regulatory authoritiescan have broad supervisory and administrative powers over such matters as licenses, fitness of management, standards of solvency, material transactions between affiliates, premium rates, policy forms, investments, security deposits, methods ofaccounting, form and content of financial statements, reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, reinsurance, minimum capital and surplus requirements and/or risk based capital standards, dividends and other distributions toshareholders, periodic examinations and annual and other report filings. In general, such regulation is for the protection of policyholders rather than shareholders. The Company believes that it is in compliance with all applicable laws andregulations pertaining to its business that would have a material effect on its financial position in the event of non-compliance.

     Bermuda Operations

     The Insurance Act 1978 of Bermuda and related regulations, as amended (the “Act”), regulates the Company's operating subsidiaries in Bermuda, and it provides that no person maycarry on any insurance business in or from within Bermuda unless registered as an insurer by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (the “Authority”) under the Act. Insurance as well as reinsurance is regulated under the Act.

     The Act imposes on Bermuda insurance companies, solvency and liquidity standards, certain restrictions on the declaration and payment of dividends and distributions, certain restrictions on thereduction of statutory capital, auditing and reporting requirements, and grants the Authority powers to supervise, investigate and intervene in the affairs of insurance companies. Significant requirements include the appointment of an independentauditor, the appointment of a loss reserve specialist and the filing of the Annual Statutory Financial Return with the Authority. The Supervisor of Insurance is the chief administrative officer under the Act.

     Under the Bermuda Companies Act 1981, as amended, a Bermuda company may not declare or pay a dividend or make a distribution out of contributed surplus if there are reasonable grounds forbelieving that: (a) the company is, or would after the payment be, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due; or (b) the realizable value of the company's assets would thereby be less than the aggregate of its liabilities and its issuedshare capital and share premium accounts.

     United States

     Within the United States, the Company's insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by their respective states of incorporation and by otherjurisdictions in which they do business. The methods of regulation vary, but in general have their source in statutes that delegate regulatory and supervisory powers to an insurance official. The regulation and supervision relate primarily toapproval of policy forms and rates, the standards of solvency that must be met and maintained, including risk-based capital standards, material transactions between an insurer and its affiliates, the licensing of insurers, agents and brokers,restrictions on insurance policy terminations, the nature of and limitations on the amount of certain investments, limitations on the net amount of insurance of a single risk compared to the insurer's surplus, deposits of securities for thebenefit of poli-cyholders, methods of accounting, periodic examinations of the financial condition and market conduct of insurance companies, the form and content of reports of financial condition required to be filed, and reserves for unearnedpremiums, losses, expenses and other obligations. All transactions between or among the insurance and reinsurance company subsidiaries must be fair and equitable. In general, such regulation is for the protection of policyholders rather thanshareholders.

     Regulations generally require insurance and reinsurance companies to furnish information to their domestic state insurance department concerning activities that may materially affect theoperations, management or financial condition and solvency of the company. Regulations vary from state to state but generally require that each primary insurance company obtain a license from the department of insurance of a state to conductbusiness in that state. A reinsurance company is not generally required to have an insurance license to reinsure a U.S. ceding company from outside the U.S. However, for a U.S. ceding company to obtain financial statement credit for reinsuranceceded, the reinsurer must obtain an insurance license or accredited status from the cedent's state of domicile or another U.S. state with equivalent insurance regulation or must post collateral to support the liabilities ceded. In addition,regulations for reinsurers vary somewhat from primary insurers in that the form and rate of reinsurance contracts and the market conduct of reinsurers are not subject to regulator approval.

     The Company's U.S. insurance subsidiaries are required to file detailed annual and, in most states, quarterly reports with state insurance regulators in each of the states in which theyare licensed. Such annual and quarterly reports are required to be prepared on a calendar year basis. In addition, the U.S. insurance subsidiaries' operations and accounts are subject to financial condition and market conduct examination atregular intervals by state regulators. The respective reports filed in accordance with applicable insurance regulations with respect to the most recent periodic examinations of the U.S. insurance subsidiaries contained no material adversefindings.

26


     Statutory surplus is an important measure utilized by the regulators and rating agencies to assess the Company's U.S. insurance subsidiaries' ability to support business operationsand provide dividend capacity. The Company's U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory and regulatory restrictions that limit the amount of dividends that may be paid from earned surplus without prior approval fromregulatory authorities. These restrictions differ by state, but are generally based on a calculation of the lesser of 10% of statutory surplus or 100% of net investment income.

     Most states have implemented laws that establish standards for current, as well as continued, state licensing or accreditation. In addition, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners(the “NAIC”) promulgated and all states have adopted Risk-Based Capital (“RBC”) standards for property and casualty companies and life insurance companies as a means of monitoring certain aspects affecting the overall financialcondition of insurance companies. RBC is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer's statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business. The NAIC's RBC Model Law provides for four incremental levels of regulatoryattention for insurers whose surplus is below the calculated RBC target. These levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to actually placing the insurer under regulatory control. TheCompany's current RBC ratios for its U.S. subsidiaries are satisfactory and such ratios are not expected to result in any adverse regulatory action. The Company is not aware of any such actions relative to it.

     While the federal government does not directly regulate the insurance business (other than for flood, nuclear and reinsurance of losses from terrorism), federal legislation and administrativepolicies can affect the insurance industry. The federal government has also undertaken initiatives in several areas that may impact the insurance industry including tort reform, corporate governance and the taxation of insurance companies. Inaddition, legislation has been introduced from time to time in recent years that, if enacted, could result in the federal government assuming a more direct role in the regulation of the insurance industry, primarily as respects federal licensing inlieu of state licensing.

     European Union

     Financial services including insurance, reinsurance, securities and Lloyd's in the United Kingdom are regulated by the Financial Services Authority (“FSA”). The FSA'sHandbook of Rules and Guidance (the “FSA Rules”) covers all aspects of regulation including capital adequacy, financial and non-financial reporting and certain activities of U.K.-regulated firms. The Company's subsidiaries carryingout regulated activities in the U.K. comply with the FSA Rules. The Company's Lloyd's managing agency, its managed syndicates and its associated corporate capital vehicles are subject to additional requirements of the Council ofLloyd's franchise.

     FSA regulations also impact the Company as “controller” (an FSA defined term) of its U.K.-regulated subsidiaries. Through the FSA's Approved Persons regime, certain employees andDirectors are subject to regulation by the FSA of their fitness and certain employees are individually registered at Lloyd's.

     Subsidiaries in Ireland, Hungary and France are regulated in those jurisdictions. The Company's network of offices in the European Union consists mainly of branches of U.K. and Irishcompanies that are principally regulated under European Directives from their home states, the U.K. and Ireland rather than by each individual jurisdiction.

     International Operations

     A substantial portion of the Company's general insurance business and a majority of its life insurance business is carried on in foreign countries. The degree of regulation in foreignjurisdictions can vary. Generally, the Company's subsidiaries must satisfy local regulatory requirements. Licenses issued by foreign authorities to subsidiaries of the Company are subject to modification or revocation for cause by suchauthorities. The Company's subsidiaries could be prevented, for cause, from conducting business in certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate. While each country imposes licensing, solvency, auditing and financial reportingrequirements, the type and extent of the requirements differ substantially. Key areas where countries may differ include: (i) the type of financial reports to be

27


filed; (ii) a requirement to use local intermediaries; (iii) the amount of reinsurance permissible; (iv) the scope of any regulation of policy forms and rates; and (v) the type and frequency of regulatoryexaminations.

     In addition to these requirements, the Company's foreign operations are also regulated in various jurisdictions with respect to currency, amount and type of security deposits, amount andtype of reserves, amount and type of local investment and limitations on the share of profits to be returned to policyholders on participating policies. Certain countries have established reinsurance institutions, wholly or partially owned by thestate, to which admitted insurers are obligated to cede a portion of their business on terms which do not always allow foreign insurers full compensation. For further information see Item 8, Note 24 to the Consolidated FinancialStatements.

Employees

     At December 31, 2005, the Company employed approximately 3,600 employees. At that date, 385 of the Company's employees were represented by workers' councils and 423 of theCompany's employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements. The Company believes that it has a good relationship with its employees.

ITEM 1A. 

     RISK FACTORS

     Any of the following risk factors could have a significant or material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or liquidity, in addition to the otherinformation contained in this report. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business, financial condition and results of operations. In this Item 1A, “XL Capital”,“XL Group”, “we”, “our”, “ours” and “us” refer to XL Capital Ltd and its subsidiaries unless the context otherwise requires.


Risks Related to Our Company

A downgrade in our credit ratings by one or more rating agencies could materially and negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or liquidity.



     In the fourth quarter of 2005, Standard & Poor's, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (“S&P”) lowered XL Capital's core property and casualty operatingcompanies' financial strength ratings to “A+” from “AA-” and affirmed them with a stable outlook. During this period, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody's”) also lowered the insurance financialstrength ratings of XL Capital's leading insurance operating subsidiaries to “Aa3” from “Aa2” and confirmed the insurance financial strength ratings of XL Capital's leading reinsurance operating subsidiaries at“Aa3”. In October 2005, Fitch Ratings Inc. (“Fitch”) lowered the insurance financial strength ratings of XL Capital's lead insurance and reinsurance operating subsidiaries to “AA-” from “AA.” A.M. BestCompany, Inc. (“A.M. Best”) affirmed XL Capital's financial strength rating of “A+” and XL Capital's operating subsidiaries' issuer credit ratings of “aa-” in December 2005. As our ability to underwritebusiness is dependent upon the quality of our claims paying and financial strength ratings as evaluated by these independent rating agencies, a further downgrade by any of these institutions could cause our competitive position in the insurance andreinsurance industry to suffer and make it more difficult for us to market our products. A downgrade could also result in a substantial loss of business for us as ceding companies and brokers that place such business may move to other insurers andreinsurers with higher ratings.

     A downgrade of the A.M. Best financial strength rating of XL Capital Ltd, XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd or XL Re Ltd below “A-”, which is two notches below our current A.M. Best ratingof “A+”, would constitute an event of default under our letter of credit and revolving credit facilities. A similar downgrade by A.M. Best or S&P would trigger cancellation provisions in the majority of our assumed reinsurancecontracts. See “—Risks Related to Our Company—A decline in our ratings may allow many of our clients to terminate their contracts with us,” below. Either of these events could reduce our financial flexibility and materiallyadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For further discussion, see Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”.

     S&P, Moody's and Fitch have assessed “triple-A” (outlook stable) financial strength ratings to our financial guaranty companies, XL Capital Assurance Inc. (“XLCA”)and XL Financial Assurance Ltd. (“XLFA”). A downgrade, rating watch or outlook change of the financial strength ratings of XLCA or XLFA by one or more rating agencies would have an adverse effect on the competitive position of XLCA andXLFA and reduce their future business opportunities. Such a downgrade would reduce the value of the reinsurance offered by XLFA, as financial guaranty primary insurers usually must obtain triple-A-rated reinsurance to qualify for a 100% reinsurancecredit on the rating agencies' capital adequacy models. Also, certain of XLFA's reinsurance agreements contain provisions that allow the ceding primary insurer to terminate the agreement in the event of a downgrade in XLFA's creditratings or other event that would result in the reinsurance credit provided by XLFA to the ceding primary insurer being diminished. To address rating agency requirements regarding the differential between the triple-A ratings of our financialguaranty companies and their affiliated companies in the XL Group, we are currently exploring a number of strategies that would provide greater independence and stability to XLCA's and XLFA's ratings. Examples of actions identified by therating agencies are, among other things, the inclusion of additional independent directors to the boards of directors of our financial guaranty companies; adding some level of outside high-quality ownership with voting and/or veto rights; andsecuring a resolution from each of the boards of directors of our financial guaranty companies that clarifies

29


our expectations regarding cash payments from the financial guaranty companies. S&P has stated that one or more of these actions will need to be taken by mid-year 2006.

A decline in our ratings may allow many of our clients to terminate their contracts with us.



     The majority of our assumed reinsurance contracts contain provisions that would allow our clients to cancel the contract in the event of a downgrade in our ratings below specified levels by oneor more rating agencies. Based on premium value, approximately 70% of our reinsurance contracts that incepted at January 1, 2005 contained provisions allowing clients additional rights upon a decline in our ratings.

     Typically, the cancellation provisions in our assumed reinsurance contracts would be triggered if S&P or A.M. Best were to downgrade our financial strength ratings below “A-”,which is equivalent to more than two levels below our current S&P rating of “A+” and more than two levels below our current A.M. Best rating of “A+”. Whether a client would exercise its cancellation rights after such adowngrade would likely depend, among other things, on the reasons for the downgrade, the extent of the downgrade, the prevailing market conditions, the degree of unexpired coverage, and the pricing and availability of replacement reinsurancecoverage. In the event of such a downgrade, we cannot predict whether or how many of our clients would actually exercise such cancellation rights or the extent to which any such cancellations would have a material adverse effect on our financialcondition or future prospects.

Losses related to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma and other natural catastrophes have adversely affected our fiscal year 2005 results and uncertainty regarding estimated losses may further impact our financialcondition, results of operations and/or liquidity.



     Based on current loss reports and estimates at December 31, 2005, we had pre-tax net losses arising from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma and the combined impact of other previously announcednatural catastrophes in 2005 of approximately $1.27 billion, $357.9 million, $247.1 million and $96.0 million, respectively. After taking into account net reinstatement premiums and tax effects, we had net losses due to thesecatastrophes of approximately $1.87 billion. However, calculating such estimates involves the exercise of considerable judgment and they are accordingly subject to revision. These losses have materially adversely affected our fiscal year 2005results.

     Our loss estimates are based upon a review of contracts that we believe are exposed to these catastrophes, loss reports received from brokers and cedents, industry loss models andmanagement's best judgment, including as to the availability and collectibility of reinsurance. We expect that the loss adjustment processes for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita will be protracted due to the unprecedented complexity and scale ofthese events.

     Actual losses may vary materially from our estimates. Such variances may be caused by a number of factors, including receipt of additional information from insureds or brokers, the attributionof losses to coverages that had not previously been considered as exposed and inflation in repair costs due to additional demand for labor and materials. In addition, such loss estimates include a high level of uncertainty related to, among otherthings, complex coverage issues, claims data received to date and potential legal developments that may result in ultimate losses not being known for a considerable period of time as well as the availability and collectibility of reinsurance.Therefore, these losses may ultimately be materially greater than currently estimated. If our actual losses exceed our estimates, our financial condition and results of operations could be further materially adversely affected.

We have exhausted certain of our reinsurance and retrocessional coverage with respect to losses related to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma leaving us exposed to further losses.



     Based on our current estimates of losses related to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and, to a lesser degree, Wilma, we believe that we have exhausted portions of our reinsurance and retrocessionalcoverage with respect to such losses, meaning that, in certain cases, we will have no further reinsurance or retrocessional coverage available should our losses related to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma prove to be greater than currentestimates. If losses related to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma prove to be greater than current estimates, to the extent that such adverse development affects lines of business with respect to which we have exhausted our reinsurance orretrocessional coverage, such adverse development could have a further material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of opera-

30


tions. We cannot assure you that reinsurance or retrocessional coverage with respect to the lines of business affected by the Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, in thefuture. Elimination of all or portions of our reinsurance or retrocessional coverage could subject us to increased, and possibly material, exposure or could cause us to underwrite less business.

We may be unable to make full recovery of the reinsurance recoverables related to the Winterthur Business, either from third parties or from Winterthur Swiss Insurance Company (“WSIC”).



     Under the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement, as amended, between XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd and WSIC (the “SPA”), WSIC provides us with protection with respect to third partyreinsurance receivables and recoverables related to our acquisition of certain Winterthur International insurance operations (the “Winterthur Business”), which were approximately $1.6 billion, in the aggregate, as of December 31, 2005.There are two levels of protection from WSIC for these balances:

       
        1.     

        At the time of the Winterthur International acquisition,the Seller provided to the Company a liquidity facility. At the time of the paymentof the net reserve seasoned amount on December 12, 2005, the Company exercisedits  right to repay up to the balances outstanding on this facility by assignmentto WSIC of an equal amount of receivables relating to reinsurance recoverablesselected by the Company. During December 2005, the Company assigned $265.4million of receivables to WSIC under this arrangement, although WSIC has disputedthe assignment of certain of these receivables


   
   
   

   
        2.

        Under two retrocession agreements the Company has reinsuranceprotection on the reinsurance recoverables with respect to the SNRA determinedas of June 30, 2004 to the extent that the Company does not receive payment of such amounts from applicable reinsurers with one agreement providing a limitof $1.3 billion for the insurance written in the period to June 30, 2001and the other agreement providing a limit of $1.3 billion for the insurancewritten in the  period to December 31, 2000.



     Certain reinsurers responsible for some portions of the reinsurance of the Winterthur Business have raised issues as to whether amounts claimed are dueand discussions are currently ongoing to achieve a resolution. 

     We may record a loss in future periods if any or some of the following occur and any such loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results ofoperations:

there is deterioration of the net reserves and premium balances relating to the Winterthur Business from
 what was reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements; and/or

we are unable to make full recovery of the reinsurance recoverables related to the Winterthur Business,
 either from third parties or from WSIC under the additional protections describedabove.


Our financial condition could be adversely affected by the occurrence of disasters.



     We have substantial exposure to losses resulting from natural and man-made disasters and other catastrophic events. Catastrophes can be caused by various events, including hurricanes,earthquakes, floods, hailstorms, explosions, severe winter weather, fires, war, acts of terrorism, political instability and other natural or man-made disasters. The incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable and our lossesfrom catastrophes could be substantial.

     The occurrence of claims from catastrophic events is likely to result in substantial volatility in our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal quarter or year in which acatastrophic event occurs, as well as subsequent fiscal periods, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and our ability to write new business. This risk is exacerbated due to accountingprinciples and rules that do not permit reinsurers to reserve for such catastrophic events until they occur. We expect that increases in the values and concentrations of insured property will increase the severity of catastrophic events in thefuture. Although we attempt to manage our exposure to catastrophic events, a single catastrophic event could affect multiple geographic zones and lines of business and the frequency or severity of catastrophic events could exceed our estimates, ineach case potentially

31


having a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, while we may, depending on market conditions, purchase catastrophe reinsurance and retrocessional protection, theoccurrence of one or more major catastrophes in any given period could result in losses that exceed such reinsurance and retroces-sional protection and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and result insubstantial liquidation of investments and outflows of cash as losses are paid.

The failure of any of the risk management strategies that we employ could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and/or liquidity.



     We seek to limit our loss exposure by, among other things, writing a number of our reinsurance contracts on an excess of loss basis, adhering to maximum limitations on reinsurance written indefined geographical zones, limiting program size for each client and prudently underwriting each program written. In addition, in the case of proportional treaties, we generally seek to use per occurrence limitations or loss ratio caps to limit theimpact of losses from any one event. We cannot be sure that all of these loss limitation methods will have the precise risk management impact intended. For instance, although we also seek to limit our loss exposure by geographic diversification,geographic zone limitations involve significant underwriting judgments, including as to the determination of the area of the zones and the inclusion of a particular policy within a particular zone's limits. Underwriting involves the exercise ofconsiderable judgment and the making of important assumptions about matters that are inherently unpredictable and beyond our control, and for which historical experience and probability analysis may not provide sufficient guidance. The failure ofany of the risk management strategies that we employ could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Also, we cannot assure you that various provisions of our policies, such as limitations or exclusionsfrom coverage or choice of forum, will be enforceable in the manner that we intend and disputes relating to coverage and choice of legal forum may arise, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results ofoperations.

The failure of our initiative to reduce our net catastrophe exposed risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and/or liquidity.



     Certain of our insurance accounts have the potential for significant volatility under worsening catastrophe event scenarios. In connection with our initiative to reduce our net catastropheexposed risks, we intend to reduce exposure from such accounts, reduce catastrophe sublimits and eliminate insurance accounts that no longer meet our increased pricing needs. In addition, we plan to reduce our reinsurance catastrophe exposure withinthe property risk portfolio and restructure the way in which our marine excess of loss programs are written. If we are unable to carry out our initiative to reduce our net catastrophe exposed risks, or do so on a timely basis, we may not be able tomeet rating agencies' additional capital requirements and our financial condition and results of operations and/or liquidity could be materially adversely affected.

If actual claims exceed our loss reserves, our financial results could be adversely affected.



     Our results of operations and financial condition depend upon our ability to assess accurately the potential losses associated with the risks that we insure and reinsure. We establish reservesfor unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense (“LAE”) liabilities, which are estimates of future payments of reported and unreported claims for losses and related expenses with respect to insured events that have occurred. The process ofestablishing reserves for property and casualty claims can be complex and is subject to considerable variability as it requires the use of informed estimates and judgments. Actuarial estimates of unpaid loss and LAE liabilities are subject topotential errors of estimation, which could be significant, due to the fact that the ultimate disposition of claims incurred prior to the date of such estimation, whether reported or not, is subject to the outcome of events that have not yetoccurred. Examples of these events include the accuracy of the factual information on which the estimates were based, especially as this develops, jury decisions, court interpretations, legislative changes, changes in the medical condition ofclaimants, public attitudes, and economic conditions such as inflation. Any estimate of future costs is subject to the inherent limitation on the ability to predict the aggregate course of future events. It should therefore be expected that theactual emergence of loss and LAE liabilities will vary, perhaps materially, from any estimate. We have an actuarial staff in

32


each of our operating segments that regularly evaluates the levels of loss reserves, taking into consideration factors that may impact the ultimate losses incurred. Any such evaluation could result in future changes inestimates of losses or reinsurance recoverable and would be reflected in our results of operations in the period in which the estimates are changed. Losses and loss expenses, to the extent that they exceed the applicable reserves, are charged toincome as incurred. The reserve for unpaid losses and loss expenses represents the estimated ultimate losses and loss expenses less paid losses and loss expenses, and comprises case reserves and incurred but not reported loss reserves(“IBNR”). During the loss settlement period, which can span many years in duration for casualty business, additional facts regarding individual claims and trends often will become known and case reserves may be adjusted by allocation fromIBNR without any change in the overall reserve. In addition, application of statistical and actuarial methods may require the adjustment of the overall reserves upward or downward from time to time. Accordingly, the ultimate settlement of losses maybe significantly greater than or less than reported loss and loss expense reserves.

Operational risks, including human or systems failures, are inherent in our business.



     Operational risk and losses can result from, among other things, fraud, errors, failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper internal authorization, failure to comply withregulatory requirements, information technology failures, or external events.

     We believe that our modeling, underwriting and information technology and application systems are critical to our business. Moreover, our information technology and application systems havebeen an important part of our underwriting process and our ability to compete successfully. We have also licensed certain systems and data from third parties. We cannot be certain that we will have access to these, or comparable, service providers,or that our information technology or application systems will continue to operate as intended. A major defect or failure in our internal controls or information technology and application systems could result in management distraction, harm to ourreputation or increased expense. We believe appropriate controls and mitigation procedures are in place to prevent significant risk of defect in our internal controls, information technology and application systems, but internal controls provideonly reasonable, not absolute, assurance as to the absence of errors or irregularities and any ineffectiveness of such controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business.

The effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain.



     As industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. These issues may adversely affect ourbusiness by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims. In some instances, these changes may not become apparent until some time after we have issued the insurance or reinsurance contractsthat are affected by the changes. For example, our actual losses in connection with the 2005 natural catastrophes may vary materially from our current estimate based on a number of factors, including receipt of additional information from insuredsor brokers, the attribution of losses to coverages that had not previously been considered as exposed and inflation in repair costs due to additional demand for labor and materials. As a result, the full extent of liability under an insurance orreinsurance contract may not be known for many years after such contract is issued.

We may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available to us on satisfactory terms, or at all.



     Our future capital requirements depend on many factors, including our ability to write new business successfully and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover ourlosses. To the extent that the funds generated by our ongoing operations are insufficient to fund future operating requirements and cover claim payments, we may need to raise additional funds through financings or curtail our growth and reduce ourassets. Any future equity or debt financing may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, if at all. Any future equity financings could be dilutive to our existing shareholders or could result in the issuance of securities that haverights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our other securities. Our inability to obtain adequate capital could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We may be unable to purchase reinsurance and, even if we are able to successfully purchase reinsurance, we are subject to the possibility of uncollectability.



     We purchase reinsurance for our own account in order to mitigate the volatility that losses impose on our financial condition. Our clients purchase reinsurance from us to cover part of the riskoriginally written by them. Retrocessional reinsuranceinvolves a reinsurer ceding to another reinsurer, the retrocessionaire, all orpart of the reinsurance that the first reinsurer has assumed. Reinsurance, includingretrocessional reinsurance, does not legally discharge the ceding company fromits liability with respect to its obligations to its insureds or reinsureds.A reinsurer's or retrocessionaire's insolvency, inability or refusal to make timely payments under the terms of itsagreements with us, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on us because we remain liable to our insureds and reinsureds. At December 31, 2005, we had approximately $7.5 billion of reinsurance recoverables, net of reserves foruncollectible recoverables. For further information regarding our reinsurance exposure, see Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”.

     From time to time, market conditions may limit or prevent us from obtaining the types and amounts of reinsurance that we consider adequate for our business needs such that we may not be able toobtain reinsurance or retroces-sional reinsurance from entities with satisfactory creditworthiness in amounts that we deem desirable or on terms that we deem appropriate or acceptable.

Since we depend on a few brokers for a large portion of our revenues, loss of business provided by any one of them could adversely affect us.



     We market our insurance and reinsurance products worldwide primarily through insurance and reinsurance brokers. Marsh & McLennan Companies and AON Corporation and their respectivesubsidiaries provided approximately 21% and 17%, respectively, of our gross written premiums from general operations for the year ended December 31, 2005. Loss of all or a substantial portion of the business provided by one or more of these brokerscould have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our reliance on brokers subjects us to credit risk.


     In certain jurisdictions, when an insured or ceding insurer pays premiums for policies of insurance or contracts of reinsurance to brokers for further payment to us, such premiums might beconsidered to have been paid and the insured or ceding insurer will no longer be liable to us for such amounts, whether or not we have actually received the premiums from the broker. In addition, in accordance with industry practice, we generallypay amounts owed on claims under our reinsurance contracts to brokers, and these brokers, in turn, pay these amounts over to the clients that have purchased reinsurance from us. Although the law is unsettled and depends upon the facts andcircumstances of the particular case, in some jurisdictions, if a broker fails to make such a claims payment to the insured or ceding insurer, we might remain liable to the insured or ceding insurer for that non-payment. Consequently, we assume adegree of credit risk associated with the brokers with whom we transact business. Due to the unsettled and fact-specific nature of the law governing these types of scenarios, we are unable to quantify our exposure to this risk. To date, we have notexperienced any material losses related to such credit risks.

Our investment performance may adversely affect our financial results and ability to conduct business.



     Our funds are invested by a number of professional investment advisory management firms under the direction of our management team in accordance with detailed investment guidelines set by us.Although our investment policies stress diversification of risks, conservation of principal and liquidity, our investments are subject to market-wide risks and fluctuations, as well as to risks inherent in particular securities. Investment lossescould significantly decrease our asset base, thereby adversely affecting our ability to conduct business and pay claims.

We may be adversely affected by interest rate changes.


     Our operating results are affected, in part, by the performance of our investment portfolio. Our investment portfolio contains interest rate sensitive instruments, such as fixed incomesecurities, which may be adversely affected by

34


changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates could also have an adverse effect on our investment income and results of operations. For example, if interest rates decline, funds reinvested will earn less thanexpected.

     Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control.Although we take measures to manage the economic risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment, we may not be able to mitigate the interest rate risk of our assets relative to our liabilities. Our mitigation efforts with respect tointerest rate risk are primarily focused towards maintaining an investment portfolio with diversified maturities that has a weighted average duration that is approximately equal to the duration of estimated future paid liabilities. However, ourestimate of future paid liabilities may be inaccurate and we may be forced to liquidate investments prior to maturity at a loss in order to cover liabilities. In addition, even if the duration of our fixed income portfolio perfectly matched futurepaid liabilities, a sharp rise in interest rates would cause the market value of our fixed income portfolio to decline and could have a material adverse effect on our book value.

     For further information regarding our exposure to interest rate risk and other investment portfolio risks, see Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About MarketRisk”.

Our operating results may be adversely affected by currency fluctuations.



     Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar and exchange rate fluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar may materially impact our financial position and results of operations. Many of ournon-U.S. subsidiaries maintain both assets and liabilities in local currencies, which exposes us to changes in currency exchange rates to the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars into such local currencies or vice versa. In addition,locally-required capital levels are invested in home currencies in order to satisfy regulatory requirements and to support local insurance operations regardless of currency fluctuations. Foreign exchange rate risk is reviewed as part of our riskmanagement process. The principal currencies creating foreign exchange risk for us are the British pound sterling, the euro and the Swiss franc.

     While we utilize derivative instruments such as futures, options and foreign currency forward contracts to, among other things, manage our foreign currency exposure, it is possible that theseinstruments will not effectively mitigate all or a substantial portion of our foreign exchange rate risk.

Current legal and regulatory activities relating to insurance brokers and agents, contingent commissions and certain finite-risk insurance products could adversely affect our business, financial condition and resultsof operations.



     Contingent commission arrangements and finite-risk reinsurance have become the focus of investigations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and U.S.Attorney's Offices and state Attorneys General. Finite-risk reinsurance has been defined as a form of reinsurance in which, among other things, the time value of money is considered in the product's design and pricing, and there is lessrisk transfer to the insurer or reinsurer in return for less premium being paid.

     In May and June of 2005, we received a subpoena from the SEC and a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, respectively, in each case fordocuments and information relating to certain finite risk and loss mitigation insurance products. We are fully cooperating with, and responding to, these requests.

     On August 1, 2005, plaintiffs in a proposed class action multi-district lawsuit (the “MDL”) filed a consolidated amended complaint, which named as new defendants in the pending actionapproximately 30 entities, including XL Capital Ltd and its subsidiaries XL Insurance America, Inc., Greenwich Insurance Company and Indian Harbor Insurance Company. In the MDL, named plaintiffs have asserted various claims, purportedly on behalfof a class of commercial insureds, against approximately 113 insurance companies and insurance brokers through which the named plaintiffs allegedly purchased insurance. The amended complaint alleges that the defendant insurance companies andinsurance brokers conspired to manipulate bidding practices for insurance policies in certain insurance lines and failed to disclose certain commission arrangements. The named plaintiffs have asserted statutory claims under the

35


Sherman Act, various state antitrust laws and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, as well as common law claims alleging breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty and unjustenrichment.

     From time to time, we have also received and responded to additional requests from state Attorneys General and insurance regulators for information relating to our contingent commissionarrangements with brokers and agents, and our insurance and reinsurance practices in connection with certain finite-risk and loss mitigation insurance products. Similarly, our affiliates outside the United States have, from time to time, receivedand responded to requests from regulators relating to our insurance and reinsurance practices. We are fully cooperating with these requests.

     At this time, we are unable to predict the potential effects, if any, that these investigations may have upon us, the insurance and reinsurance markets in general or industry and reinsurancebusiness practices or what, if any, changes may be made to laws and regulations regarding the industry and financial reporting. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The loss of one or more key executives or the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could adversely affect our ability to conduct business.



     Our success depends on our ability to retain the services of our existing key executives and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel in the future. The loss of the services of anyof our key executives or the inability to hire and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. In addition, we do not maintain key man life insurance policies with respect to ouremployees.

     Many of our senior executives working in Bermuda are not Bermudian and our success may depend in part on the continued services of key employees in Bermuda. Under Bermuda law, non-Bermudians(other than spouses of Bermudians and holders of permanent resident certificates) may not engage in any gainful occupation in Bermuda without an appropriate governmental work permit. A work permit may be granted or renewed by the Bermuda governmentfor a specific period of time, upon showing that, after proper public advertisement, no Bermudian (or spouse of a Bermudian or holder of a permanent resident certificate) is available who meets the minimum standards reasonably required by anemployer with respect to a certain position. The government of Bermuda places a six-year term limit on individuals with work permits, subject to certain exemptions for key employees. No assurances can be given that any work permit will be issued or,if issued, renewed upon the expiration of the relevant term.

Because we are a holding company, if our subsidiaries do not make dividend and other payments to us, we may not be able to pay dividends or make payments on our debt securities and other obligations.



     As a holding company with no direct operations or significant assets other than the capital stock of our subsidiaries, we rely on investment income, cash dividends and other permitted paymentsfrom our subsidiaries to make principal and interest payments on our debt, to pay operating expenses and common and preferred shareholder dividends and to pay other obligations of ours that may arise from time to time. We expect future investmentincome, dividends and other permitted payments from these subsidiaries to be our principal source of funds to pay such expenses, preferred and common stock dividends and obligations. The payment of dividends to us by our insurance and reinsurancesubsidiaries is limited under Bermuda laws and certain insurance statutes of various states in the United States in which our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are licensed to transact business.

     Our U.S. insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are subject to state regulatory restrictions that generally require cash dividend to be paid only out of earned statutory surplus. Further, theamount payable without the prior approval of the applicable state insurance department is generally limited to the greater of 10% of policyholders' surplus or statutory capital, or 100% of the subsidiary's prior year statutory net income.In addition, Bermuda insurance laws and regulations (i) require our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries to maintain certain minimum solvency margins and minimum liquidity ratios, (ii) prohibit dividends that would result in a breach of theserequirements, and (iii) limit the amount by which we can reduce surplus without prior approval from the Bermuda Monetary Authority.

36


     In addition, the ability of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries to pay dividends could be constrained by our dependence on financial strength ratings from independent rating agencies.Our ratings from these agencies depend to a large extent on the capitalization levels of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries. Any such restriction on our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends to us could have amaterial adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries may not always be able to, or may not, pay preferred and common stock dividends to us sufficient to make our debt payments andpay our operating expenses, shareholder dividends or other obligations. 

Risks Related to Our Industry

The insurance and reinsurance industries are historically cyclical and we may experience periods with excess underwriting capacity and unfavorable premium rates.



     The insurance and reinsurance industries have historically been cyclical, characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excess underwriting capacity as well as periods whenshortages of capacity permitted favorable premium levels. An increase in premium levels is often offset by an increasing supply of insurance and reinsurance capacity, either by capital provided by new entrants or by the commitment of additionalcapital by existing insurers or reinsurers, which may cause prices to decrease. Either of these factors could lead to a significant reduction in premium rates, less favorable policy terms and conditions and fewer submissions for our underwritingservices. In addition to these considerations, changes in the frequency and severity of losses suffered by insureds and insurers may affect the cycles of the insurance and reinsurance industries significantly.

Competition in the insurance and reinsurance industries could reduce our operating margins.



     The insurance and reinsurance industries are highly competitive. We compete on an international and regional basis with major U.S., Bermudian, European and other international insurers andreinsurers and with underwriting syndicates, some of which have greater financial and management resources than we do. We also compete with new companies that continue to be formed to enter the insurance and reinsurance markets. In addition, capitalmarket participants have recently created alternative products that are intended to compete with reinsurance products. Increased competition could result in fewer submissions, lower premium rates and less favorable policy terms and conditions, whichcould reduce our margins.

Unanticipated losses from terrorism and uncertainty surrounding the future of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.



     Following the September 11th terrorist attacks, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as amended by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005, (“TRIA”) was enacted toensure the availability of insurance coverage for “certified” acts of terrorism in the U.S and is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2007. Pursuant to TRIA, in the event of a “certified” act of terrorism, the U.S. Government maybecome liable to pay, above a specified deductible, a portion of up to 90% of our U.S. insurance operations' losses in fiscal years 2005 and 2006 and 85% of such losses in fiscal year 2007. This deductible is based on prior year gross writtenpremiums for certain commercial lines multiplied by a specified percentage, which is 15%, 17.5% and 20% for fiscal years 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. Given the incremental increase in the deductible percentage, the amount of our deductible for2007 could increase substantially, depending upon the amount of certain direct commercial earned premiums written in 2006. Insurance companies are allowed to purchase commercial reinsurance for their deductible amounts and quota share exposure,however to date there has not been a viable market for such reinsurance coverage in terms of capacity, price or coverage terms. Currently, there is uncertainty as to what effect the changes to TRIA will have on the insurance industry.

     Our Lloyds & U.S.-based property and casualty insurers are subject to TRIA. Accordingly, TRIA does not apply to our non-U.S. and non-Lloyds insurance business, or our reinsuranceoperations.

37


     While we believe our risk management programs, together with the coverage provided under the TRIA are sufficient to reasonably limit our net losses relating to potential future terroristattacks, we can offer no assurance in that regard. It is not possible to eliminate completely our exposure to unforecasted or unpredictable events, and to the extent that losses from such risks occur, our financial condition and results ofoperations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, despite the implementation and extension of the TRIA there remains an uncertainty regarding the future of terrorism coverage should the U.S. government not further extend the TRIA afterits expiration on December 31, 2007, or pass subsequent terrorism legislation.

     Potential government intervention in our industry as a result of recent events and instability in the marketplace for insurance products could hinder our flexibility and negatively affectthe business opportunities that may be available to us in the market.



     Government intervention and the possibility of future government intervention have created uncertainty in the insurance and reinsurance markets. Government regulators are generally concernedwith the protection of policyhold-ers to the exclusion of other constituencies, including shareholders of insurers and reinsurers. While we cannot predict the exact nature, timing or scope of possible governmental initiatives, such proposals couldadversely affect our business by, among other things:

Providing insurance and reinsurance capacity in markets and to consumers that we target;

Requiring our participation in industry pools and guaranty associations;

Expanding the scope of coverage under existing policies, e.g., following large disasters such as Hurricanes
 Katrina and Rita;

Regulating the terms of insurance and reinsurance policies; or

Disproportionately benefiting the companies of one country over those of another.


     The insurance industry is also affected by political, judicial and legal developments that may create new and expanded theories of liability, which may result in unexpected claims frequency& severity and delays or cancellations of products and services by insureds, insurers and reinsurers which could adversely affect our business.

Risks Related to Regulation

The regulatory regimes under which we operate, and potential changes thereto, could have a material adverse effect on our business.



     Our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries operate in 29 countries around the world as well as in all 50 U.S. states. Our operations in each of these jurisdictions are subject to varyingdegrees of regulation and supervision. The laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are domiciled require, among other things, that these subsidiaries maintain minimum levels of statutory capital,surplus and liquidity, meet solvency standards, submit to periodic examinations of their financial condition and restrict payments of dividends and reductions of capital. Statutes, regulations and policies that our insurance and reinsurancesubsidiaries are subject to may also restrict the ability of these subsidiaries to write insurance and reinsurance policies, make certain investments and distribute funds.

     In recent years, the U.S. insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny. In addition, some state legislatures have considered or enacted laws that may alter orincrease state regulation of insurance and reinsurance companies and holding companies. Moreover, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, which is the organization of insurance regulators from the 50 U.S. states, the District ofColumbia and the four U.S. territories, as well as state insurance regulators regularly reexamine existing laws and regulations.

     We may not be able to comply fully with, or obtain desired exemptions from, revised statutes, regulations and policies that govern the conduct of our business. Failure to comply with, or toobtain desired authorizations and/or exemptions under, any applicable laws could result in restrictions on our ability to do business or undertake activities that are regulated in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate and couldsubject us to fines and other sanc-

38


tions. In addition, changes in the laws or regulations to which our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are subject, or in the interpretations thereof by enforcement or regulatory agencies, could have a material adverseeffect on our business.

If our Bermuda operating subsidiaries become subject to insurance statutes and regulations in jurisdictions other than Bermuda or if there is a change in Bermuda law or regulations or the application of Bermuda law orregulations, there could be a significant and negative impact on our business.



     XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd and XL Re Ltd, two of our wholly-owned operating subsidiaries, are registered Bermuda Class 4 insurers. As such, they are subject to regulation and supervision inBermuda. Bermuda insurance statutes and the regulations and policies of the Bermuda Monetary Authority require XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd and XL Re Ltd to, among other things:

maintain a minimum level of capital and surplus;

maintain solvency margins and liquidity ratios;

restrict dividends and distributions;

obtain prior approval regarding the ownership and transfer of shares;

maintain a principal office and appoint and maintain a principal representative in Bermuda;

file an annual statutory financial return; and

allow for the performance of certain periodic examinations of XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd and XL Re Ltd
 and their respective financial conditions.


     These statutes and regulations may restrict our ability to write insurance and reinsurance policies, distribute funds and pursue our investment strategy.

     We do not presently intend for XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd and XL Re Ltd to be admitted to do business in the United States, the United Kingdom or any jurisdiction other than Bermuda. However,we cannot assure you that insurance regulators in the United States, the United Kingdom or elsewhere will not review the activities of XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd or XL Re Ltd, their respective subsidiaries or their agents and claim that XL Insurance(Bermuda) Ltd or XL Re Ltd is subject to such jurisdiction's licensing requirements. If any such claim is successful and XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd or XL Re Ltd must obtain licenses in a jurisdiction other than Bermuda, we may be subject to taxation in such jurisdiction.

     In addition, XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd and XL Re Ltd are subject to indirect regulatory requirements imposed by jurisdictions that may limit their ability to provide insurance or reinsuranceto that jurisdiction's domestic insurers or reinsurers. For example, the ability of XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd and XL Re Ltd to write insurance or reinsurance may be subject, in certain cases, to a country's limits on how much reinsurancecan be purchased from non-domestic reinsurers or requirements that such non-domestic reinsurers collateralize their payment obligations to domestic ceding companies. If we are unable to collateralize or provide other credit support for thesereinsurance clients on commercially reasonable terms, we could be limited in our ability to write business for some of our clients. Proposed legislation and regulations may have the effect of imposing additional requirements upon, or restricting themarket for, non-domestic insurers or reinsurers with whom domestic companies place business.

     Generally, Bermuda insurance statutes and regulations applicable to XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd and XL Re Ltd are less restrictive than those that would be applicable if they were governed bythe laws of any state in the United States. If in the future we become subject to any insurance laws of the United States or any state thereof or of any other jurisdiction, we cannot assure you that we would be in compliance with such laws or thatcomplying with such laws would not have a significant and negative effect on our business.

     The process of obtaining licenses is very time consuming and costly and XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd and XL Re Ltd may not be able to become licensed in jurisdictions other than Bermuda should wechoose to do so. The modification of the conduct of our business that would result if we were required or chose to become licensed in certain jurisdictions could significantly and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.In addi-

39


tion, our inability to comply with insurance statutes and regulations could significantly and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations by limiting our ability to conduct business as well assubjecting us to penalties and fines.

     Because XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd and XL Re Ltd are Bermuda companies, they are subject to changes in Bermuda law and regulation that may have an adverse impact on our operations, includingthrough the imposition of tax liability or increased regulatory supervision. In addition, XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd and XL Re Ltd will be exposed to any changes in the political environment in Bermuda, including, without limitation, changes as aresult of the independence issues currently being discussed in Bermuda. The Bermuda insurance and reinsurance regulatory framework recently has become subject to increased scrutiny in many jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom. While we cannotpredict the future impact on our operations of changes in the laws and regulation to which we are or may become subject, any such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Risks Related to Taxation

We and our Bermuda insurance subsidiaries may become subject to taxes in Bermuda after March 28, 2016, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.



     We and our Bermuda insurance subsidiaries have received from the Ministry of Finance in Bermuda exemptions from any Bermuda taxes that might be imposed on profits, income or any capital asset,gain or appreciation until March 28, 2016. The exemptions are subject to the proviso that they are not construed so as to prevent the application of any tax or duty to such persons as are ordinarily resident in Bermuda (we and our Bermuda insurancesubsidiaries are not so currently designated) and to prevent the application of any tax payable in accordance with the provisions of The Land Tax Act 1967 or otherwise payable in relation to the land leased to us and our Bermuda insurancesubsidiaries. We, as a permit company under The Companies Act 1981 of Bermuda, have received similar exemptions, which are effective until March 28, 2016. We and our Bermuda insurance subsidiaries are required to pay certain annual Bermudagovernment fees and certain business fees as an insurer under The Insurance Act 1978 of Bermuda. Currently there is no Bermuda withholding tax on dividends paid by our Bermuda insurance subsidiaries to us. Given the limited duration of the Ministryof Finance's assurance, we cannot be certain that we or our Bermuda insurance subsidiaries will not be subject to any Bermuda tax after March 28, 2016. Such taxation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results ofoperations.

We may become subject to taxes in the Cayman Islands after June 2, 2018, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.



     Under current Cayman Islands law, we are not obligated to pay any taxes in the Cayman Islands on our income or gains. We have received an undertaking from the Governor-in-Council of the CaymanIslands pursuant to the provisions of the Tax Concessions Law, as amended, that until June 2, 2018, (i) no subsequently enacted law imposing any tax on profits, income, gains or appreciation shall apply to us and (ii) no such tax and no tax in thenature of an estate duty or an inheritance tax shall be payable on any of our ordinary shares, debentures or other obligations. Under current law, no tax will be payable on the transfer or other disposition of our ordinary shares. The Cayman Islandscurrently impose stamp duties on certain categories of documents; however, our current operations do not involve the payment of stamp duties in any material amount. The Cayman Islands also currently impose an annual corporate fee upon all exemptedcompanies incorporated in the Cayman Islands. Given the limited duration of the undertaking from the Governor-in-Council of the Cayman Islands, we cannot be certain that we will not be subject to any Cayman Islands tax after June 2, 2018. Suchtaxation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

40


We and our Bermuda insurance subsidiaries may become subject to U.S. tax, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.



     We take the position that neither we nor any of our Bermuda insurance subsidiaries are engaged in a U.S. trade or business through a U.S. permanent establishment. Accordingly, we take theposition that none of our Bermuda insurance subsidiaries should be subject to U.S. tax (other than U.S. excise tax on insurance and reinsurance premium income attributable to insuring or reinsuring U.S. risks and U.S. withholding tax on some typesof U.S. source investment income). However, because there is considerable uncertainty as to the activities that constitute being engaged in a trade or business within the United States, we cannot be certain that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service(the “IRS”) will not contend successfully that we or any of our Bermuda insurance subsidiaries are engaged in a trade or business in the United States. If we or any of our Bermuda insurance subsidiaries were considered to be engaged in atrade or business in the United States, any such entity could be subject to U.S. corporate income and additional branch profits taxes on the portion of its earnings effectively connected to such U.S. business, in which case our financial conditionand results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is considering measures that might change the manner in which we are taxed.



     On June 27, 2005 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) issued a discussion draft, “
Attribution of Profits to aPermanent Establishment—Release of Discussion Draft of Part IV (Insurance)

” (the “Draft”), which constitutes the fourth and final part of the report on OECD's project to establish a broad consensus regarding the interpretationand practical application of Article 7 (“Article 7”) of the OECD ModelTax Convention on Income and on Capital. Article 7 sets forth international taxprinciples for attributing profits to a permanent establishment and forms thebasis of an extensive network of bilateral income tax treaties between OECD membercountries and between many OECD member and non-member countries. Once finalized,the conclusions of Parts I-IV of the report will be implemented through revisionof the Commentary on Article 7 and/or Article 7 itself. Section C of the Draftdiscusses the application of the 1995 OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines to insurancebusiness conducted between associated enterprises and, if adopted in its currentform, might change the manner in which we are taxed and could therefore impactour future after-tax profitability. We cannot predict the effect of any suchchanges.

ITEM 2. 

     PROPERTIES

     The Company operates in the United States, Bermuda, Europe and various other locations around the world. In 1997, the Company acquired commercial real estate in Hamilton, Bermuda for thepurpose of securing long-term office space for its worldwide headquarters. The development was completed in April 2001. The total cost of this development, including land, was approximately $126.6 million.

     In July 2003, the Company acquired new offices at 70 Gracechurch Street, London, which have become the Company's new London headquarters. The acquisition was made through a purchase, saleand leaseback transaction. The move to the new offices was completed in 2004 and consolidated the Company's London businesses in one location. The Company has recorded a capital lease asset and liability of approximately $150.0 millionrelated to this transaction.

     The majority of all other office facilities throughout the world that are occupied by the Company and its subsidiaries are leased.

     Total rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was approximately $34.9 million, $31.2 million and $42.3 million, respectively. See Item 8, Note 18(d) to theConsolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the Company's lease commitments for real property.

ITEM 3. 

     LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     On June 21, 2004, a consolidated and amended class action complaint (the “Amended Complaint”) was served on the Company and certain of its present and former directors and officers asdefendants in a putative class action (Malin et al. v. XL Capital Ltd et al.) filed in United States District Court, District of Connecticut (the “Malin Action”). The Malin Action purports to be on behalf of purchasers of theCompany's common stock between November 1, 2001 and October 16, 2003, and alleges claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder (the “Securities Laws”). The AmendedComplaint alleged that the defendants violated the Securities Laws by, among other things, failing to disclose in various public and shareholder and investor reports and other communications the alleged inadequacy of the Company's loss reservesfor its NAC Re subsidiary (now known as XL Reinsurance America, Inc.) and that, as a consequence, the Company's earnings and assets were materially overstated. On August 26, 2005, the Court dismissed the Amended Complaint owing to its failureadequately to allege “loss causation,” but provided leave for the plaintiffs to file a further amended complaint. The plaintiffs thereafter filed a second amended complaint (the “Second Amended Complaint”), which is similar tothe Amended Complaint in its substantive allegations. On December 31, 2005, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint. The plaintiffs have opposed the motion. The Company and the defendant present and former officers and directors intend to vigorously defendthe claims asserted against them.

     On June 17, 2004, William Kronenberg, III, Frank A. Piliero and David M. Rosenberg (together, the “Claimants”) commenced an arbitration against the Company before the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in New York, New York. The Claimants and the Company were parties to a stock purchaseagreement dated June 1, 1999, pursuant to which the Company acquired the outstanding capital stock of ECS, Inc. (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”). In their AAA arbitration demand, the Claimants asserted claims of fraud and deceitfulconduct, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract and a covenant of good faith and fair dealing, all relating to the allegation that the Company failed to make certain contingent payments allegedly due to the Claimants under the StockPurchase Agreement. Claimants sought $85 million (the maximum amount payable under the contingent payment provision at issue), plus punitive damages, interest, costs and attorneys' fees. On February 21, 2006, the AAA panel issued a finalaward in favor of the Company with respect to the major disputes at issue. The AAA panel referred certain remaining accounting issues to additional arbitration proceedings before an independent accounting firm pursuant to rulings of the UnitedStates District Court for the Southern District of New York and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit concerning the scope of the AAA arbitration. The Claimants have not yet taken a position as to the extent of any damages theymay still claim in such arbitration in light of the AAA panel's award. Ifthe

Claimants proceed to arbitration before the accounting firm, the Company will continue to vigorously defend the Claimants' claims.

     The Company is also subject to litigation and arbitration in the normal course of its business. These lawsuits and arbitrations principally involve claims on policies of insurance and contractsof reinsurance and are typical for the Company and for the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industry in general. Such legal proceedings are considered in connection with the Company's loss and loss expense reserves. Reserves invarying amounts may or may not be established in respect of particular claims proceedings based on many factors, including the legal merits thereof. In addition to claims litigation, the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to lawsuits in thenormal course of business that do not arise from or directly relate to claims on policies of insurance or contracts of reinsurance.

     As previously disclosed, in May and June of 2005, the Company received a subpoena from the SEC and a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of NewYork, respectively, in each case for documents and information relating to certain finite-risk and loss mitigation insurance products. The Company is fully cooperating and responding to these requests.

     From time to time, the Company has also received and responded to additional requests from Attorneys General and state insurance regulators for information relating to the Company'scontingent commission arrangements with brokers and agents and the Company's insurance and reinsurance practices in connection with certain finite-risk and loss mitigation products. Similarly, the Company's affiliates outside the UnitedStates have, from time to time, received and responded to requests from regulators relating to the Company's insurance and reinsurance practices regarding contingent commissions or finite-risk and loss mitigation products. The Company is fullycooperating with these regulators in these matters.

     On August 1, 2005, plaintiffs in a proposed class action multi-district lawsuit, captioned 
In re Insurance Brokerage Antitrust Litigation

, MDL No. 1663, Civil Action No. 04-5184 (FSH) (the “MDL”), filed a consolidated amended complaint (the “Amended Complaint”), which named as new defendants in the pending action approximately 30 entities,including Greenwich Insurance Company, Indian Harbor Insurance Company and XL Capital Ltd. In the MDL, named plaintiffs have asserted various claims, purportedly on behalf of a class of commercial insureds, against approximately 113 insurancecompanies and insurance brokers through which the named plaintiffs allegedly purchased insurance. The Amended Complaint alleges that the defendant insurance companies and insurance brokers conspired to manipulate bidding practices for insurancepolicies in certain insurance lines and failed to disclose certain commission arrangements. The named plaintiffs have asserted statutory claims under the Sherman Act, various state antitrust laws and the Racketeer Influenced and CorruptOrganizations Act, as well as common law claims alleging breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment. Discovery in the MDL continues. Defendants filed motions to dismiss the Amended Complaint inlate November 2005. On February 1, 2006, plaintiffs filed a motion seeking leave to further amend their Amended Complaint to, among other things, add additional defendants, including X.L. America, Inc. and XL Insurance America, Inc. That motion was denied without prejudice. On or about February 13, 2006, plaintiffs  filed a motion seeking class certification.

     The Company believes that the ultimate outcome of all outstanding litigation and arbitration will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition, future operatingresults and/or liquidity, although an adverse resolution of a number of these items could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations in a particular fiscal quarter or year.

     Each Class A ordinary share has one vote, except if, and so long as, the Controlled Shares (defined below) of any person constitute ten percent (10%) or more of the issued Class A ordinaryshares, the voting rights with respect to the Controlled Shares owned by such person are limited, in the aggregate, to a voting power of approximately 10%, pursuant to a formula specified in the Articles of Association. “Controlled Shares”includes, among other things, all Class A ordinary shares which such person is deemed to beneficially own directly, indirectly or constructively (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or Section 958 of theInternal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended).

     The number of record holders of Class A ordinary shares as of December 31, 2005 was 932. This figure does not represent the actual number of beneficial owners of the Company's Class Aordinary shares because such shares are frequently held in “street name” by securities dealers and others for the benefit of individual owners who may vote the shares.

     In 2005, four quarterly dividends were paid at $0.50 per share to all ordinary shareholders of record as of March 10, June 9, September 8 and December 8. In 2004, four regular quarterlydividends were paid at $0.49 per share to all ordinary shareholders of record as of March 8, June 7, September 6 and December 6.

     Management has recommended that the Board of Directors reduce the future quarterly dividend payable on the Company's Class A ordinary shares to $0.38 per share.

     On January 27, 2006, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.38 per share payable on March 31, 2006 to shareholders of record on March 15, 2006.

     The declaration and payment of future dividends by the Company will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including the Company's earnings,financial condition, business needs, capital and surplus requirements of the Company's operating subsidiaries and regulatory and contractual restrictions.

     As a holding company, the Company's principal source of income is dividends or other statutorily permissible payments from its subsidiaries. The ability to pay such dividends is limited bythe applicable laws and regulations of

46


the various countries that the Company operates in, including Bermuda, the United States and the U.K., and those of the Society of Lloyd's, and certain contractual provisions. See Item 7, “Management'sDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Item 8, Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

     Rights to purchase Class A ordinary shares (“Rights”) were distributed as a dividend at the rate of one Right for each Class A ordinary share held of record as of the close ofbusiness on October 31, 1998. Each Right entitles holders of Class A ordinary shares to buy one ordinary share at an exercise price of $350. The Rights would be exercisable, and would detach from the Class A ordinary shares, only if a person orgroup were to acquire 20% or more of the Company's outstanding Class A ordinary shares, or were to announce a tender or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in a person or group beneficially owning 20% or more of Class A ordinaryshares. Upon a person or group without prior approval of the Board acquiring 20% or more of Class A ordinary shares, each Right would entitle the holder (other than such an acquiring person or group) to purchase Class A ordinary shares (or, incertain circumstances, Class A ordinary shares of the acquiring person) with a value of twice the Rights exercise price upon payment of the Rights exercise price. The Company will be entitled to redeem the Rights at $0.01 per Right at any timeuntil the close of business on the tenth day after the Rights become exercisable. The Rights will expire at the close of business on September 30, 2008, and do not initially have a fair value. The Company has initially reserved 119,073,878 Class Aordinary shares being authorized and unissued for issue upon exercise of Rights.

        Results for all periods subsequent to July 1, 2001 include the results of Winterthur International, which was acquired with effect from this date. The results also include the consolidation of XL Re Europe, which has beenaccounted for as a subsidiary with effect from January 1, 2002. In the year ended December 31, 2001 the Company's share of net income of Le Mans RÉ (now known as XL Re Europe) was included in equity in net income of operating affiliates.The Company's net income for the years ended December 31, 2001 and after was impacted by the September 11 event. The effect of all of these items should be considered when making period to period comparisons of the Company's results ofoperations and financial condition and liquidity.

     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


     This “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contains forward-looking statements which involve inherent risks and uncertainties.Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about the Company's beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. These statements are based upon current plans, estimates and expectations. Actual results may differmaterially from those projected in such forward-looking statements, and therefore undue reliance should not be placed on them. See “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” for a list of additional factors that could causeactual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.

     This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto presented under Item 8.

     Certain aspects of the Company's business have loss experience characterized as low frequency and high severity. This may result in volatility in both the Company's results ofoperations and financial condition.

Executive Overview

     The Company operates on a global basis primarily in the property and casualty industry and, to a lesser extent, the financial services industry. The Company serves the insurance, reinsuranceand financial services needs of institutional and corporate clients, typically the global equivalent of the Fortune 2000. The Company operates in markets where the Company believes its underwriting expertise and financial strength represent arelative advantage. The Company does not operate in any retail markets.

     The property and casualty insurance and reinsurance markets have historically been cyclical, meaning that based on market conditions, there have been periods where premium rates are high andpolicy terms and conditions are more favorable (a “hard market”) to the Company and there have been periods where premium rates decline and policy terms and conditions are less favorable (a “soft market”) to the Company. This hasbeen driven primarily by competition in the marketplace, the supply of capital in the industry, investment yields and the frequency and severity of loss events. Management's goal is to build long-term shareholder value by capitalizing oncurrent opportunities and managing through any potential downward cycles by reducing its property and casualty book of business and exposures if and when rates deteriorate to unprofitable levels for the Company. As part of its long-term strategy,the Company also looks to its financial products and services segment to provide a diversified stream of earnings that are not directly tied to the property and casualty cycle. In this regard, the Company's financial guaranty operations havesubstantially achieved relative trading parity with its peers.

     The Company has grown through acquisition activity and development of new business opportunities. Acquisitionsincluded Global Capital Underwriting Ltd in 1996, Mid Ocean Limited in 1998,ECS, Inc. and NAC Re Corp. in 1999, Winterthur International in 2001 and Le MansRÉ in 2002. All acquisitions have supportedthe Company's strategic plan to develop a global platform in insurance and reinsurance. Recent business developments include XL Capital Assurance Inc. and XL Financial Assurance Ltd., the Company's financial guaranty primary andreinsurance guarantors, XL Weather & Energy Inc. and XL Life Insurance & AnnuityCompany. As a result of these combined developments, the Company now competesas an integrated global business with more than 3,500 employees in 29 countries.

     The Company earns its revenue primarily from net premiums written and earned. Premium rates in the property and casualty industry began to increase in 2001 following five years of poorunderwriting performance in the industry. These price increases were further compounded by the September 11 event. In the three years ended December 31, 2003, the Company experienced pricing increases and improved terms and conditions across most ofthe lines of business it writes. These generally across-the-board price increases were unprecedented, meaning that, in the past, pricing increases and more favorable terms and conditions were not experienced across all of the Company's productlines at one point in any one cycle.

50


     During 2004, property and casualty market conditions overall remained attractive although price competition increased throughout the year, most notably in regards to property and professionallines. Accordingly, the Company continued to focus on disciplined risk selection. In relation to insurance and reinsurance, downward pressure on rates across most non-catastrophe exposed lines continued throughout 2005 although the impact of the2004 storm season, the backdrop of continued emergence of adverse development related to the market of the late 1990s and concerns about reinsurer financial strength, all served to reinforce a sense of discipline in the market.

     Subsequent to the unprecedented catastrophic losses in 2005 and into the 2006 first quarter renewals, the market in general has seen an improvement in terms and conditions as well as pricing,in particular in geographic territories and classes impacted by the catastrophe losses. Casualty and professional lines, which have seen significant price reductions in 2004 and 2005, have begun to stabilize. In the Reinsurance segment, however,these improvements have been offset somewhat by increased ceding company retentions which is common in a hardening market. While the Company is not focused on top line premium growth unless it is profitable and meets demanding standards and internalhurdle rates, the Company's expectation is for flat earned premium growth for the full year of 2006, with insurance contributing flat to low single digit growth and reinsurance contributing flat to mid-single digit declines.

     The Company also generates revenue from investment activities through returns on its investment portfolio. The Company's current investment strategy seeks to support the liabilitiesarising from the operations of the Company, generate investment income and build book value over the longer term. During both 2005 and 2004, interest rates in the U.S. increased. During 2005, the U.S. yield curve flattened significantly, as short tomedium term rates increased significantly while long-term rates showed a small decline. The benchmark 90-day treasury rose from 2.22% to 4.08% and the 5-year treasury rose from 3.61% to 4.35%, while the 30-year treasury fell from 4.83% to 4.54% .Interest rates declined in the U.K., where the yield on the benchmark 5-year Gilt fell from 4.49% to 4.17%, however, in the Euro-zone, the yield on the benchmark 5-year German Bund rose slightly from 3.03% to 3.07% .

     The Company expects net investment income to rise in 2006 supported by positive cash flow from operating activities and anticipated moderate increases in market interest rates.

     In 2005, the Company generated net realized gains from both its equity and fixed income portfolios, reflecting the current and accumulated performance of the capital markets. In 2004, theCompany generated net realized gains from both its equity and fixed income portfolios reflecting the overall performance of capital markets and the deterioration of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies. In 2003, the Company generated netrealized gains from both its equity and fixed income portfolios reflecting the overall improvement in capital markets and narrowing of credit spreads.

     The Company's profitability in any given period is based upon its premium and investment revenues as noted above, less net losses incurred and expenses. Net losses incurred are based uponclaims paid and changes to unpaid loss reserves. Unpaid loss reserves are estimated by the Company and include both reported loss reserves and reserves for losses incurred but not reported. The Company's results for 2005 were significantlyimpacted by the unprecedented insured hurricane losses during the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, the charge related to the conclusion of the independent actuarial process with Winterthur Swiss Insurance Company and adverse development of prior yearloss reserves in both insurance professional lines and reinsurance casualty lines. The Company's results for 2004 were also significantly impacted by the catastrophe activity in the year, which resulted in $591.2 million in estimated netloss and loss expenses, combined with adverse prior year development in certain lines of the Company's insurance segment. For a further discussion of these events see “Results of Operations” below.

     Underwriting profit (loss) - general operations

     One way that the Company evaluates the performance of its insurance and reinsurance general operations is the underwriting profit or loss. The Company does not measure performance based on theamount of gross premiums written. Underwriting profit or loss is calculated from premiums earned and fee income, less net losses incurred and expenses related to the underwriting activities. As noted above, the Company's underwriting profit andloss for the last three years have been negatively impacted by net losses incurred from catastrophic losses, the results of the independent actuarial process with Winterthur Swiss Insurance Company and adverse development of prior year lossreserves. Partially offsetting this has been the addition of certain new business lines, the increase in premium rates in 2003 and favorable underwriting terms and conditions. Any changes to loss reserves affect the calculation of underwritingprofit or loss but most often do not directly affect the Company's cash flow in the same period. See further discussion below. Barring any unusual catastrophic loss events, the Company expects to produce an underwriting profit in2006.

     Combined ratio - general operations

     The combined ratio for general operations is used by the Company and many other insurance and reinsurance companies as another measure of underwriting profitability. The combined ratio iscalculated from the net losses incurred and underwriting expenses as a ratio of the net premiums earned for the Company's general insurance and reinsurance operations. A combined ratio of less than 100% indicates an underwriting profit and over100% indicates an underwriting loss. The Company's combined ratio for the last three years have been negatively impacted by the factors affecting the underwriting profit (loss), noted above.

     Net investment income - general operations

     Net investment income from its general operations is an important measure that affects the Company's overall profitability. The largest liability of the Company relates to its unpaid lossreserves and the Company's investment portfolio provides liquidity for claims settlements of these reserves as they become due, and thus a significant part of the portfolio is in fixed income securities. Net investment income is primarilyaffected both by the size of the portfolio and the level of market interest rates. In 2005, the U.S. yield curve flattened significantly with U.S. short to medium term interest rates increasing markedly while long term rates showed a small decline.U.K. rates declined, while in the Euro-zone short term rates rose while medium to long term rates declined. In 2004, U.S. interest rates increased moderately while interest rates in the U.K. and Euro-zone declined. The size of the portfolio is alsoimpacted by cash flow generated from operations and financing, which has been positive during the last three years and which the Company currently expects to be positive in 2006.

     Book value per ordinary share

     Management also views the change in the Company's book value per ordinary share as an additional measure of the Company's performance. Book value per share is calculated by dividingordinary shareholders' equity by the number of outstanding ordinary shares at any period end. Book value per ordinary share is affected primarily by

52


the Company's net income and also by any changes in the net unrealized gains and losses on its investment portfolio. The Company's book value per ordinary share decreased in 2005 as a result of the underwritinglosses incurred, partially offset by the significant capital-raising during December 2005, where ordinary shares were issued at a premium to the book value at that time. During 2005, book value per share also decreased as a result of a decrease inthe unrealized gains on the Company's investment portfolio. The decrease was primarily as a result of increasing short to medium term U.S. interest rates, partially offset by declining longer term U.K. interest rates. The Company's bookvalue per ordinary share increased in 2004, primarily as a result of an increase in net income combined with an increase in the net unrealized gains on the investment portfolio. The increase in unrealized gains on the Company's fixed incomeportfolio was primarily a result of the foreign exchange benefits for non-U.S. dollar investments partially offset by a moderate increase in interest rates in the U.S.

     Return on average ordinary shareholders' equity

     Return on average ordinary shareholder's equity (“ROE”) is a widely used measure of any company's profitability. It is calculated by dividing the net income for any periodby the average of the opening and closing ordinary shareholders' equity. The Company establishes minimum target ROEs for its total operations, segments and lines of business. If the Company's minimum ROE targets over the longer term arenot met with respect to any line of business, the Company seeks to modify and/or exit these lines. In addition, the Company's compensation of its senior officers is significantly dependent on the achievement of the Company's performancegoals to enhance shareholder value as measured by ROE. The Company reported a loss in 2005 and ROEs for the prior two years have been negatively affected mainly by its general operations' underwriting results and investment income.

Other Key Focuses of Management


     Ratings and Capital Management


     The Company's ability to underwrite business is largely dependent upon the quality of its claims paying and financial strength ratings as evaluated by independent rating agencies. As aresult, in the event that the Company's financial strength rating is downgraded, its ability to write business will be adversely affected. Such a downgrade would also adversely affect the Company's financial guaranty lines of business.During the third and fourth quarters of 2005 a number of ratings actions were taken by independent rating agencies including some downgrades of the Company's principal insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries. The Company subsequently raised$3.2 billion through an issuance of a combination of ordinary shares and equity security units. The financial strength ratings of the Company's financial guaranty companies remain “triple A” with a stable outlook (by Standard& Poor's, Moody's and Fitch Ratings). For a further discussion see “Ratings” above.

     To address rating agency requirements regarding the differential between the triple-A ratings of the Company's financial guaranty companies and their affiliated companies,management is currently exploring a number of strategies that would provide greater independence and stability to XLCA's and XLFA's ratings. Examples of actions identified by the rating agencies are, among other things, the inclusion ofadditional independent directors to the boards of directors of the Company's financial guaranty companies; adding some level of outside high-quality ownership with voting and/or veto rights; and securing a resolution from each of the boards ofdirectors of the Company's financial guaranty companies that clarifies our expectations regarding cash payments from the financial guaranty companies. S&P has stated that one or more of these actions will need to be taken by mid-year2006.

     In the normal course of business, the Company evaluates its capital needs to support the volume of business written in order to maintain its claims paying and financial strength ratings. Inresponse to the unprecedented insured hurricane losses during the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, the loss related to the conclusion of the independent actuarial process with WSIC, rising capital requirements for the property catastrophe businessfrom rating agencies and the currently anticipated growth in business to be written in 2006, the Company raised $3.2 billion in capital through the issuance of a combination of ordinary shares and equity security units. In addition, the Companyhas implemented several key business initiatives with ratings and capital management implications.

       
        1.     

        Management has entered into a strategic initiative intended to augment the Company's overall underwriting capacity to take advantage of opportunities in certain catastrophe-exposed lines of business. Management hasentered into a collateralized quota share reinsurance treaty with Cyrus Reinsurance Limited. Under this agreement, as of January 1, 2006, the Company cedes specified portions of the Company's property catastrophe reinsurance and retrocessionlines of business.

    ening catastrophe event scenarios, reduce catastrophe        sublimits and eliminate accounts that no longer meet the Company's        increased pricing needs. In addition to the strategic initiative noted        above, the Reinsurance segment's management intends to reduce catastrophe        exposure within the property risk portfolio and restructure the way in    which marine excess of loss programs are written.

  

     Operational Efficiency and Effectiveness

     The Company's ability to compete is influenced by its operational efficiency and effectiveness, including the development and retention of its people. In recognition of this, the Companyhas in place and continues to develop, programs and initiatives aimed at enhancing its position in these areas. For example, the Company continues to make significant investments in information technology in both the Insurance and Reinsurancesegments, develop and implement a new framework for Financial Reporting and Controls, and establish an operations center, based in, India. Each of these projects requires considerable investment and commitment of the Company's resources in aneffort to achieve the ultimate goals of increased operational efficiency and effectiveness.

     Collateral Management

     Another important matter on which management is focused (and which also affects the Company's ability to underwrite business) is the availability of collateral. Collateral includes lettersof credit, insurance trusts and other credit facilities required to provide security to cedants (which are companies who reinsure their liabilities to the Company), particularly as required by state insurance regulation in the U.S. and atLloyd's, and also to provide the Company with liquidity as required. These facilities are provided to the Company from commercial banks. Our principal credit facilities have tenors of two, three, and five years. The Company has also utilized“off balance sheet” transactions in order to obtain more collateral capacity (these transactions are described below under “Variable Interest Entities and Other Off Balance Sheet Arrangements”). As the Company writes morebusiness, its collateral requirements will increase. A key challenge for management is to ensure that sufficient collateral capacity is available as to not hinder future writing of business.

     Liquidity and cash flow

     As a property and casualty insurer, the Company must ensure that it has sufficient funds to settle claims promptly, especially upon the occurrence of a major catastrophic event. Management isfocused on making sure that liquidity requirements are supported by having lines of credit facilities available to the Company as well as by the Company's general investment portfolio of which the majority is in high grade fixed incomesecurities. The Company has had significant positive cash flow from operations in the three years ended December 31, 2005 generated from its underwriting activities (premiums less claim and expense settlements) as well as the receipt of investmentincome on its portfolio. In addition during 2005, capital raising activity provided significant cash flows from financing activities. The Company expects cash flow from operations to be positive in 2006.

     The Company's net (loss) income and other financial measures as shown above for the three years ended December 31 have been affected, among other things, by the following significantitems:

       
        1)     

        Significant large catastrophe activity;


 

   
        2)

        The impact of the unvaforable result of the independent actuarial process with Winterthur Swiss Insurance Company;


 

   
        3)

        Net adverse prior year loss development in general insurance and reinsurance operations;


 

   
        4)

        Growing asset base and positive performance from investments in affiliates.



     1. Significant large catastrophe activity (Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and other natural catastrophes)


     During the third and fourth quarters of 2005, there was an unprecedented number of natural catastrophes. In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina, a Category 4 storm, hit the Gulf Coast of the UnitedStates and is estimated to have caused the largest ever insured loss from a natural disaster in the property and casualty insurance industry. In September 2005, Hurricane Rita, a Category 3 storm, hit the Gulf Coast on the United States and causedconsiderable damage, although Rita was less severe than Katrina. In October 2005, Hurricane Wilma hit South Florida after causing significant damage in Mexico and Cuba. In addition, there were several other natural loss events in the third andfourth quarter 2005, including hurricanes Dennis, Emily and Ophelia, the European and Mumbai Floods and Typhoon Mawar (collectively, the “Other Cats”). Collectively, Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Wilma, and these Other Cats have had asubstantial impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.

     As a result of the substantial impact the Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Wilma and the Other Cats have had on the results of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company hasestimated losses incurred, net of reinsurance recoveries, of $1.27 billion, $357.9 million and $247.1 million and $96.0 million, respectively, based on preliminary reports and estimates of such loss and damage. The Company hasperformed an analysis of contracts it believes are exposed to these catastrophes and, together with other preliminary information received from insureds and cedents and industry models, has determined its best estimates at this time for the expectedultimate loss. Actual losses may vary materially from this estimate based on a number of factors, including receipt of additional information from insureds or brokers, the attribution of losses to coverages and/or layers that had not previously beenconsidered as exposed and inflation in repair costs due to additional demand for labor and materials. In addition, the loss estimate includes a high level of uncertainty related to, among other things, complex coverage issues associated withHurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma and potential legal developments that may result in ultimate losses not being known for a considerable period of time. Therefore, losses may ultimately be materially greater or lesser than the current estimate andaccordingly impact future financial results. Losses in connection with these events were incurred almost equally from the Company's Insurance and Reinsurance segments.

     The year ended December 31, 2004 was negatively impacted by four hurricanes, Frances, Charley, Ivan and Jeanne, for a total net loss of $516.6 million, net of reinsurance recoveries. Inaddition, the Company incurred net losses and loss expenses of $74.6 million in 2004 as a result of the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami that struck South Asia on December 26, 2004.

     The following are analyses of the financial impact on the Company's results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 from natural catastrophes:

     2. Losses related to the result of the independent actuarial process with Winterthur Swiss Insurance Company


     On December 6, 2005, the Company received the report from the Independent Actuary in connection with the Company's post-closing protection for adverse development of net loss and unearnedpremium relating to the acquisition of certain Winterthur International insurance operations from Winterthur Swiss Insurance Company (“WSIC”) in 2001.

     The Independent Actuary's report concluded that WSIC's submitted Seasoned Net Reserve Amount (“SNRA”) and Net Premium Receivable Amount (“NPRA”) were closest tothe Independent Actuary's determinations of SNRA and NPRA. These determinations resulted in the Company receiving a net lump sum payment in the amount of approximately $575.0 million (including interest receivable) from WSIC. As the Companyhad recorded $1.4 billion in unpaid losses and loss expenses recoverable related to this protection, a loss of approximately $808.9 million, net of interest, was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005.

     3. Net adverse prior year loss development

     Net adverse prior year loss development occurs when there is an increase to loss reserves recorded at the beginning of the year, resulting from actual or reported loss development for prioryears exceeding expected loss development. The net adverse prior year loss development in 2005 related to the Company's general insurance operations most notably in the casualty and professional lines of business.

     The results for the year ended December 31, 2005 have been negatively impacted by adverse development in both the Insurance and Reinsurance segments. The following table presents the netadverse (favorable) prior year loss development of the Company's loss and loss expense reserves for its general and financial operations by each operating segment for each of the years indicated:

     During 2005, the Insurance segment's net adverse prior year development of $1.02 billion includes the results of the independent actuarial process noted above. Excluding thisdevelopment the remaining $185.8 million was driven primarily by increases in reported case reserves for excess professional liability. Strengthening of $259.5 million in professional lines was caused primarily by the establishment of casereserves on both directors' and officers' claims in pre-2002 business, and errors and omissions claims. Strengthening of $34.7 million within other specialty lines was caused primarily by increases in reported losses for specialtylines of business currently in run-off including certain Lloyd's business, discontinued programs business, and surety. A net release of $108.4 million for global risks lines of business was driven by the reduction in case reserves forpre-2002 claims primarily relating to casualty business written out of Europe.

     During 2005, net prior year reserves across the Reinsurance segment developed adversely by $93.5 million. Reserve strengthening of $266.9 million in casualty and professional lines waspartially offset by releases in other lines of business of $173.4 million. The casualty strengthening is primarily attributable to workers' compensation, umbrella liability and certain professional lines of business written in theCompany's North American operations. The reserve releases relate primarily to the property line where releases of $135.6 million occurred across all business units globally in the 2002 to 2004 underwriting years. Releases also occurred inthe marine and aviation classes of business across the reinsurance segment.

     The majority of the workers' compensation reserve increase during 2005 was related to an XL Reinsurance America Inc. (“XLRA”) working layer program written across multipleunderwriting years with a single cedent. This program was not renewed at the end of 2001. Other than this program, XLRA has not written significant working layer workers' compensation business. The remaining source of the workers'compensation reserve strengthening relates to an update of the mortality tables used in our tabular reserving methodology.

     The remainder of the strengthening in the casualty and professional lines reserves was driven by a small number of increases in reported claims in the other liability and errors and omissionslines of business in the pre-1997 underwriting years as well as recently reported claims in umbrella liability, errors and omissions and directors' and officers' lines of business in the 1997-2001 underwriting years. The professional linesclaims activity arose largely from a limited number of cedents. This reserve increase was partially offset by favorable development in the 1997- 2001 underwriting years in the medical malpractice business line. Activity in the post-2001 underwritingyears relates primarily to certain large individual claims affecting a number of lines, including surety, umbrella liability and errors and omissions.

     During 2004, the Company's net adverse prior year development of $268.0 million was a result of increases in reported insurance case reserves for excess professional liability, excesscasualty liability and specialty lines within the Insurance segment offset by net prior year releases in the Reinsurance segment. These increases in reported insurance case reserves exceeded the Company's expected losses based on historicalpatterns of loss development.

58


Strengthening of $144.0 million in professional lines was caused by a few large directors' and officers' claims in pre-2002 business, and increases in errors and omissions reserves were caused by claimsrelated to large accounting firms and to insurance/reinsurance brokers. For specialty lines, strengthening of $135.0 million was caused by reported loss increases in discontinued programs business with workers' compensation exposure,environmental related coverages, and Lloyd's as well as high severity claims on the surety book.

     During 2003, the net adverse prior period loss development related primarily to the Company's general reinsurance operations and principally to losses on business written in the 1997through 2001 underwriting years in the Company's U.S. casualty reinsurance business. In the third quarter of 2003, the Company experienced a significant increase in claims reported that was in excess of the Company's expected lossdevelopment based on historical reporting patterns and recorded an increase to reserves of $184.0 million related to this book of business. As a result of this increase, the Company began a detailed claims audit review of the cedentscontributing to this increase and the lines of business affected were primarily directors' and officers', errors and omissions, medical malpractice, commercial umbrella and general liability. Upon completion of this claims audit review,the Company increased case and IBNR reserves relating to this book of business a total of $663.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. The Company monitors actual against expected reported claims on an ongoing basis. To the extent that actualexperience on loss reserves differs significantly for this, or any other line of business, the Company would again expand its normal and ongoing cedent review program accordingly.

     4. Growing asset base and positive performance from investments in affiliates.


     Net investment income was $1.5 billion in 2005 as compared to $1.0 billion in 2004 due primarily to a larger investment base combined with higher investment yields, as well as receiptof a distribution associated with the unwinding of a collateralized debt obligation which resulted in a one time benefit to investment income, and the accrued interest on the proceeds from the conclusion of the independent actuarial process withWSIC. The investment portfolio increased due to growth in structured and spread balances and positive operating cash flows combined with capital raising activities late in the fourth quarter. Higher investment yields were driven primarily by theimpact of increasing U.S. interest rates on cash flow and reinvested assets. In addition, net realized gains produced by the investment portfolio and the equity earnings from the Company's affiliates also contributed positively to the year. Netrealized gains on investments were $241.9 million in 2005 compared to $246.5 million in 2004. Net income from investment affiliates was $154.8 million in 2005 compared to $124.0 million in 2004. This increase was attributable to goodunderlying alternative fund returns combined with strong results from certain private equity affiliates that benefited from a series of successful liquidation events. Net income from operating affiliates (including insurance, financial andinvestment manager affiliates) was $67.4 million in 2005 compared to $147.4 million in 2004. Earnings from investment manager affiliates were strong during 2005. Earnings from operating affiliates during 2004 included $102.1 million ofincome in connection with the sales of Admiral Group Ltd and Pareto Partners L.P. and its affiliated companies. See Item 8, Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

     The following are considered to be the Company's critical accounting policies and estimates due to the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies and/or thelikelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. If actual events differ significantly from the underlying assumptions or estimates applied for any or all of the accountingpolicies (either individually or in the aggregate), there could be a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. These critical accounting policies have been discussed by management withthe Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.

     Other significant accounting policies are nevertheless important to an understanding of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Policies such as those related to revenuerecognition, financial instruments and

59


consolidation require difficult judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance. See Item 8, Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

     1) Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses and Unpaid Loss and Loss Expenses Recoverable


     As the Company earns premiums for the underwriting risks it assumes, it also establishes an estimate of the expected ultimate losses related to the premium. Loss reserves or unpaid losses andloss expenses are established due to the significant periods of time that may lapse between the occurrence, reporting and settlement of a loss. The process of establishing reserves for unpaid property and casualty claims can be complex and issubject to considerable variability as it requires the use of informed estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are based on numerous factors, and may be revised as additional experience and other data become available and arereviewed, as new or improved methodologies are developed or as current laws change. Loss reserves include:

       
        a)     

        Case reserves - reserves for reported losses and loss expenses that have not yet been settled and,


 

   
        b)

        Losses incurred but not reported (“IBNR”).



     At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company's total gross reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses were $23.8 billion and $19.8 billion, respectively, of which $10.6 billionand $9.8 billion related to case reserves for reported claims and $13.2 billion and $10.0 billion for IBNR reserves, respectively.

     Case reserves 

for the Company's general operations are established by management based on amounts reported from insureds or ceding companies andconsultation with legal counsel, and represent the estimated ultimate cost of events or conditions that have been reported to or specifically identified by the Company. The method of establishing case reserves for reported claims differs among theCompany's operations.

     With respect to the Company's insurance operations, the Company is notified of insured losses and records a case reserve for the estimated amount of the settlement, if any. The estimatereflects the judgment of claims personnel based on general reserving practices, the experience and knowledge of such personnel regarding the nature of the specific claim and, where appropriate, advice of legal counsel. Reserves are also establishedto provide for the estimated expense of settling claims, including legal and other fees and the general expenses of administering the claims adjustment process. With respect to the Company's reinsurance general operations, case reserves forreported claims are generally established based on reports received from ceding companies. Additional case reserves may be established by the Company to reflect the estimated ultimate cost of a loss. With respect to the Company's financialproducts and services operations, financial guaranty claims incurred on policies written on an insurance basis are established consistent with the Company's insurance operations and financial guaranty claims incurred on policies written on areinsurance basis are established consistent with the Company's reinsurance operations.

     IBNR reserves 

relate mainly to the Company's insurance and reinsurance casualty business. IBNR reserves are calculated by the Company'sactuaries using several standard actuarial methodologies including paid and incurred loss development, the Bornhuetter-Ferguson incurred loss method and frequency and severity approaches.

     IBNR reserves are calculated by the Company's actuaries using standard actuarial methodologies as discussed above. Prior to the year ended December 31, 2003, the outcomes of theCompany's actuarial reviews, consistent with historical practice, provided either (i) a single point reserve estimate or (ii) a range of reserve estimates from which the Company selected a best estimate. Since the year ended December 31, 2003,the Company adopted a methodology that provided a single point reserve estimate separately for each line of business and also a range of possible outcomes across each single point reserve estimate. This is discussed further below. As a result,reserve ranges disclosed previously are not comparable to the reserve ranges disclosed herein.

     While the proportion of unpaid loss and loss expenses represented by IBNR is sensitive to a number of factors, the most significant ones have historically been accelerating business growth andchanges in business mix. Other factors that have affected the ratio in the past include; additions to prior period reserves, catastrophic occurrences, settlement of large claims and changes in claims settlement patterns.

60


     The ratio of IBNR to total reserves has increased in recent years due to the growth of casualty business written over that period. The ratio of IBNR to total reserves is higher for more recentyears' business because these immature years have relatively fewer claims reported and, as a result, a higher proportion of claims reserves are based on experience in respect of incurred but not reported losses. As each prior year of businessmatures and claims become known, the ratio of IBNR to total reserves will typically decline, all other factors remaining constant. Since the Company has experienced rapid premium volume growth in recent years, the ratio of IBNR to total reserves hasincreased because the Company's aggregate exposure has become relatively less mature. Conversely, in a situation of declining premium volume, this ratio will typically decline, all other factors remaining constant. The Company writes insuranceand reinsurance business in many different lines. Typically, the ratio of IBNR to total reserves is greater for casualty lines (which are longer-tail in nature) than for property lines due to the policy forms utilized and timing of loss reporting.In recent years, casualty lines have increased as a proportion of the Company's business when compared to property lines (which are shorter-tail in nature).

     The single point reserve estimate is generally management's best estimate, which the Company considers to be one that has an equal likelihood of developing a redundancy or deficiency asthe loss experience matures, and this amount is recorded. The Company's actuaries utilize one set of assumptions in determining its single point estimate, which includes loss development factors, loss ratios, reported claim frequency andseverity. These reviews and documentation are completed in accordance with professional actuarial standards appropriate to the jurisdictions where the business is written. The selected assumptions reflect the actuary's judgment based onhistorical data and experience combined with information concerning current underwriting, economic, judicial, regulatory and other influences on ultimate claim settlements.

     Loss and loss expenses are charged to income as they are incurred. These charges include loss and loss expense payments and any changes in case and IBNR reserves. During the loss settlementperiod, additional facts regarding claims are reported. As these additional facts are reported, it may be necessary to increase or decrease the unpaid losses and loss expense reserves. The actual final liability may be significantly different thanprior estimates.

     The Company's net unpaid loss and loss expense general and financial reserves broken down by operating segment at December 31, 2005 and 2004 were as follows:

     With the exception of the adverse development associated with the unfavorable conclusion of the independent actuarial process, actual development of recorded reserves as of December 31, 2004during 2005 was within the estimated reserve range.

     As shown in the table above and as previously noted, the Company developed a methodology for calculating reserve ranges around its single point reserve estimates for all its lines of business.Similar to VAR (Value At Risk) models commonly used to evaluate risk, the Company modeled a statistical distribution of potential reserve outcomes over a one year run-off period. The Company used the modeled statistical distribution to calculate an80% confidence interval for the potential reserve outcomes over this one year run-off period. The high and low end points of the ranges set forth in the above table are such that there is a 10% modeled probability that the reserve will develophigher than the high point and a 10% modeled probability that the reserve will develop lower than the low point.

     The development of a reserve range models the uncertainty of the claim environment as well as the limited predictive power of past loss data. These uncertainties and limitations are notspecific to the Company. The ranges represent an estimate of the range of possible outcomes over a one year development period. A range of possible outcomes should not be confused with a range of best estimates. The range of best estimates willgenerally be much narrower than the range of possible outcomes as it will reflect reasonable actuarial and management best estimates of the expected reserve.

     Reserve volatility was analyzed for each line of business within each of the Reinsurance and Insurance segments' general operations using the Company's historical data supplemented byindustry data. These ranges were then aggregated to the lines of business shown above taking into account correlation between lines of business based on a study of the Company's historical data supplemented by industry data. The practicalresult of the correlation approach to aggregation is that the ranges by line of business disclosed above, are narrower than the sum of the ranges of the individual lines of business. Similarly, the range for the Company's total reserves in theaggregate, is narrower than the sum of the ranges for the lines of business disclosed above.

     The Company is not aware of any generally accepted model to perform the reserve range analysis described above and other models may also be employed to develop ranges.

     The Company does not calculate a range for its total net unpaid loss and loss expense reserves as it would not be appropriate to add the ranges for each line of business to obtain a rangearound the Company's total reserves, because this would not reflect the diversification effects across the Company's various lines of business. The diversification effects result from the fact that losses across the Company'sdifferent lines of business are not completely correlated.

     The Company writes both “short-tail” and “long-tail” lines of business. “Short-tail” and “long-tail” describe the time between the receipt of the premiumfrom a policy and the final settlement of any loss incurred under such policy. Short-tail lines include property catastrophe, other property and certain marine and aviation lines where, on average, the settlement period may be up to 24 months.Long-tail lines, on the other hand, include the Company's casualty business in which claims may take up to 30 years to be reported and settled. The increase in the time associated with ultimate settlement of a claim is directly related to anincrease in the amount of judgment required to establish loss reserves, especially IBNR reserves.

     See further discussion under “- Segments” below for prior year development of loss reserves.

     The Company's three types of reserve exposure with the longest tails are:

       
        (1)     

        high layer excess casualty insurance;


 

   
        (2)

        casualty reinsurance; and


 

   
        (3)

        discontinued asbestos and long-tail environmental business.



     Certain aspects of the Company's casualty operations complicate the actuarial process for establishing reserves. Certain casualty business written by the Company's insuranceoperations is high layer excess casualty business,

62


meaning that the Company's liability attaches after large deductibles including self insurance or insurance from sources other than the Company. The Company commenced writing this type of business in 1986 and issuedpolicies in forms that were different from traditional policies used by the industry at that time. Initially, there was a lack of industry data available for this type of business. Consequently, the basis for establishing loss reserves by theCompany for this type of business was largely judgmental and based upon the Company's own reported loss experience which was used as basis for determining ultimate losses, and therefore IBNR reserves. Over time, the amount of availablehistorical loss experience data has increased. As a result, the Company has obtained a larger statistical base to assist in establishing reserves for these excess casualty insurance claims.

     High layer excess casualty insurance 

claims typically involve claims relating to (i) a “shock loss” such as an explosion or transportationaccident causing severe damage to persons and/or property over a short period of time, (ii) a “non-shock” loss where a large number of claimants are exposed to injurious conditions over a longer period of time, such as exposure tochemicals or pharmaceuticals or (iii) a professional liability loss such as a medical malpractice claim. In each case, these claims are ultimately settled following extensive negotiations and legal proceedings. This process can typically take 5 to15 years following the date of loss.

     Reinsurance operations 

by their nature add further complications to the reserving process, particularly for casualty business written, in that there isan inherent lag in the timing and reporting of a loss event from an insured or ceding company to the reinsurer. This reporting lag creates an even longer period of time between the policy inception and when a claim is finally settled. As a result,more judgment is required to establish reserves for ultimate claims in the Company's reinsurance operations.

     In the Company's reinsurance general operations, case reserves for reported claims are generally established based on reports received from ceding companies. Additional case reserves maybe established by the Company to reflect the Company's estimated ultimate cost of a loss.

     Casualty reinsurance business involves reserving methods that generally include historical aggregated claim information as reported by ceding companies, combined with the results of claims andunderwriting reviews of a sample of the ceding company's claims and underwriting files. Therefore, the Company does not always receive detailed claim information for this line of business.

     Discontinued asbestos and long-tail environment business 

had been previously written by NAC Re Corp. (now known as XL Reinsurance America Inc.), prior toits acquisition by the Company.

     Except for certain workers' compensation and long-term disability liabilities, the Company does not discount its unpaid losses and loss expenses. The Company utilizes tabular reserving forworkers' compensation and long-term disability unpaid losses that are considered fixed and determinable, and discounts such losses using an interest rate of 5% at December 31, 2005 and 2004. For further discussion see the Consolidated FinancialStatements.

     Financial Guaranty Loss Reserving

     The Company is aware of the SEC's recent review of the loss reserving practices in the financial guaranty industry. The Company recognizes that there is diversity in practice amongfinancial guaranty insurers and reinsurers with respect to their accounting policies. Current accounting literature, specifically FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 60 “Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises”(“FAS 60”) and FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 97 
“Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Long-Duration Contracts and for Realized Gains and Losses fromthe Sale of Investments” 

(“FAS 97”), does not specifically address the unique characteristics of financial guaranty insurance contracts. Consequently, the accounting principles applied by theindustry have evolved over time and incorporate the concepts of both short-duration and long-duration contracts accounting under the provisions of FAS 60 and FAS 97. It is the Company's understanding that the SEC has requested that the FASBreview this matter and provide guidance for the accounting of financial guaranty insurance contracts. The Company will continue its loss reserving methodology as noted in Note 2 (k) to the Consolidated Financial

63


Statements until further guidance is provided by the SEC or the FASB. The Company had net reserves for financial guaranty insurance contracts of $173.7 million and $146.3 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004,respectively.

     Unpaid losses and loss expenses recoverable

     The recognition of unpaid losses and loss expenses recoverable requires two key judgments. The first judgment involves the Company's estimation of the amount of gross IBNR to be ceded toreinsurers. Ceded IBNR is generally developed as part of the Company's loss reserving process and consequently, its estimation is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as the estimation of gross IBNR (see “Critical Accounting Policiesand Estimates - Unpaid losses and loss expenses and unpaid loss and loss expense recoverable”). The second judgment involves the Company's estimate of the amount of the reinsurance recoverable balance that the Company will ultimatelybe unable to recover from related reinsurers due to insolvency, contractual dispute, or for other reasons. Amounts estimated to be uncollectible are reflected in a bad debt provision that reduces the reinsurance recoverable balance andshareholders' equity. Changes in the bad debt provision are reflected in net income. See “Financial Condition and Liquidity” and Item 8, Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

     As a result of the Company's acquisition of Winterthur International in July 2001, WSIC provides protection to the Company with respect to third party reinsurance receivables andrecoverables related to the Winterthur International acquisition, which are $1.6 billion in the aggregate, as of December 31, 2005. The Company has reinsurance protection under two retrocession agreements on the remaining portion of reinsurancerecoverables with respect to incurred losses seasoned as of June 30, 2004 to the extent that the Company does not receive payment of such amounts from applicable reinsurers, with one agreement providing a limit of $1.3 billion for the insurancewritten in the period to June 30, 2001, and the other agreement providing a limit of $1.3 billion for the insurance written in the period to December 31, 2000.

     2) Future Policy Benefit Reserves

     Future policy benefit reserves relate to the Company's life operations and are estimated using assumptions for investment yields, mortality, expenses and provisions for adverse lossdeviation. Uncertainties related to interest rate volatility and mortality experience make it difficult to project and value the ultimate benefit payments.

     Most of the Company's future policy benefit reserves relate to annuity portfolio reinsurance contracts under which the Company makes annuity payments throughout the term of the contractfor a specified portfolio of policies.

     For certain of these contracts, a single premium is paid at inception of the contract by way of a transfer of cash and investments to the Company.

     The reserving methodology for these annuity portfolio reinsurance contracts is described in FAS 60 as amended by FAS 97. These contracts subject the Company to risks arising from policyholdermortality over a period that extends beyond the periods in which premiums are collected. Liabilities for future policy benefit reserves are established in accordance with the provisions of FAS 60.

     Claims and expenses for individual policies within these annuity reinsurance contracts are projected over the lifetime of the contract to calculate a net present value of future cash flows.Assumptions for each element of the basis (mortality, expenses and interest) are determined at the issue of the contract and these assumptions are locked-in throughout the term of the contract unless a premium deficiency exists. The assumptions arebest estimate assumptions plus provisions for adverse deviations on the key risk elements (i.e., mortality and interest). Provisions for adverse deviation are designed to cover reasonable deviations from the best estimate outcome of the contract. Asthe experience on the contracts emerges, the assumptions are reviewed. This occurs at least annually and includes both an analysis of experience and review of likely future experience. If such review would produce reserves in excess of thosecurrently held then lock-in assumptions will be revised and a loss recognized. During the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, there were no adjustments to the locked-in assumptions for any of these contracts.

64


     The future policy benefit reserves for these annuity portfolio reinsurance contracts amounted to $5.2 billion and $3.9 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Companyholds the investment assets backing these liabilities. These investments are primarily fixed income securities with maturities that closely match the expected claims settlement profile. A 0.1% decrease in the investment yield assumption would resultin a $49 million increase in the value of future claims related to annuity portfolio reinsurance.

     As stated above, the future policy benefit reserves include provisions for adverse deviation in excess of best estimate assumptions that amounted to approximately $310 million and $145million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The future policy benefit reserves would only be increased if these provisions for adverse deviation became insufficient in the light of emerging claims experience. The present value of futureclaims would increase by approximately $18 million if mortality rates were to decrease by 1% in all future years, relative to the reserving assumptions.

     The Company also provides reinsurance of disability income protection. The future policy benefit reserves for these contracts amounted to $85 million and $86 million at December 31,2005 and 2004, respectively. Future policy benefit reserves are established in accordance with the provisions of FAS 60, including the lock-in of assumptions at inception with periodic review against experience. The liabilities relate to in-forceblocks of business, comprising underlying insurance policies that provide an income if the policyholder becomes sick or disabled. The liabilities are therefore driven mainly by the rates at which policyholders become sick (where sickness is definedby the policy conditions) and by the rates at which these policyholders recover or die. A 1% increase in the incidence rate would increase the value of future claims by approximately $0.1 million, while a 1% decrease in the termination ratewould increase the value of future claims by approximately $0.4 million.

     Following a review of morbidity experience, the locked-in assumptions were revised during the year ended December 31, 2005. The overall effect of using the revised assumptions was a reductionin income of $0.4 million.

     The Company also provides reinsurance of term assurance and critical illness policies written in the U.K. and Ireland. The future policy benefit reserves for these contracts amounted to $62million and $41 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Future policy benefit reserves are established in accordance with the provisions of FAS 60, including the lock-in of assumptions at inception with periodic review againstexperience.

     The liabilities relate to in-force blocks of business, comprising underlying insurance policies that provide mainly lump sum benefits if the policyholder dies or becomes sick. For termassurance, the liabilities are therefore driven by the rates of mortality and for critical illness cover, the liabilities are driven predominantly by the rates at which policyholders become sick (where sickness is defined by the treaty conditions),i.e., the morbidity rates. A 1% increase in the mortality rate relative to the reserving assumption would increase the value of future claims by approximately $0.6 million, and a 1% increase in the morbidity rate would increase the value offuture claims by approximately $0.6 million.

     The term assurance and critical illness treaties have been written using a variety of structures, some of which incur acquisition costs during an initial period. For such treaties, a deferredacquisition cost (“DAC”) asset has been established and an increase in future lapse rates could impact the recoverability of such costs from future premiums. The recoverability will also be influenced by the impact of lapses on futureclaims. An increase in the annual lapse rates by 1% could lead to a 5%-10% reduction in future margins available for amortizing the DAC asset.

     The Company also provided reinsurance of U.S. based term assurance, which was novated to the Company from an insurance affiliate in December 2002. The future policy benefit reserves for thesecontracts amounted to $184 million and $123 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Future policy benefit reserves are established in accordance with the provisions of FAS 60, including the lock-in of assumptions at inceptionwith periodic review against experience.

     The liabilities relate to in-force blocks of business, which are comprised of underlying insurance policies that provide mainly lump sum benefits if the policyholder dies. The liabilities aretherefore driven by the rates of mortality,

65


and a 1% increase in the mortality rate relative to the reserving assumption would increase the value of future claims by approximately $8 million. Following a review of mortality experience, the locked-in assumptionswere revised during the year ended December 31, 2005. The overall affect of using the revised assumptions was a reduction in income of $63 million. See Item 8, Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

     3) Deposit Liabilities

     The Company's deposit liabilities at December 31, 2005 reflect obligations assumed under funding agreements, municipal guaranteed reinvestment contracts, payment undertaking agreements andcertain structured insurance and reinsurance agreements. For each of these contracts, the Company establishes a deposit liability equal to the net cash received at inception. Each deposit liability accrues at a rate equal to the internal rate ofreturn of the payment receipts and obligations due during the life of the agreement. Where the timing and/or amount of future payments are uncertain, cash flows reflecting the Company's actuarially determined best estimates are utilized. Theultimate size of underlying losses, the impact of the contractual limits upon settlement of such losses, and the impact of the underlying loss settlement process on the timing of payments are considered as appropriate. Where uncertainty is present,an increase in the ultimate claims cost or accelerated claims settlement would potentially lead to an increase in the deposit liability accretion rate or lead to incurred losses if significant. The interest expense reported due to the accretion ofdeposit liabilities associated with structured insurance and reinsurance contracts was $49.8 million, $59.4 million and $92.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. For some of the Company'sdeposit liabilities, the accretion rate is recorded at its contractual maximum level. For all other contracts, a 1% increase in the average accretion rate would result in an increase in deposit liabilities and interest expense by $16.3 millionon an annualized basis. See Item 8, Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

     4) Derivative Instruments

     The Company conducts activities in three main types of derivative instruments: credit derivatives, weather and energy derivatives and investment-related derivative instruments. The estimate offair value for credit derivatives and weather and energy derivatives requires management's judgment. These two activities are discussed below:

     a) Credit Derivatives

     The Company enters into credit derivatives in connection with its financial guaranty business and the Company intends to hold these contracts to maturity. In determining fair value, managementdifferentiates between investment and non-investment grade exposures and models them separately. Management estimates fair value for investment grade exposures by monitoring changes in credit quality and selecting appropriate market indices todetermine credit spread movements over the life of the contracts. The determination of the credit spread movements is the basis for calculating the fair value. For credit derivatives that are non-investment grade and therefore do not have a readilydeterminable market value, the Company uses an alternative fair value methodology. The fair value is determined using a cash flow model developed by the Company and is dependent upon a number of factors, including changes in interest rates, futuredefault rates, credit spreads, changes in credit quality, future expected recovery rates and other market factors. Installment premiums are also considered in the determination of discounted net cash flows. Other elements of the change in fair valueare based upon pricing established at the inception of the contract. Changes in fair value are unrealized as the credit derivatives are not traded to realize this value. See Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About MarketRisk” for sensitivity analysis and Item 8, Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

     b) Weather and Energy Derivatives

     The fair value of weather and energy derivatives is determined through the use of quoted market prices where available. Where quoted market prices are unavailable, the fair value is estimatedusing available market data and internal pricing models using consistent statistical methodologies. Estimating fair value of instruments that do not

66


have quoted market prices requires management's judgment in determining amounts that could reasonably be expected to be received from, or paid to, a third party in settlement of the contracts. The amounts could bematerially different from the amounts that might be realized in an actual sale transaction. Fair values are subject to change in the near-term and reflect management's best estimate based on various factors including, but not limited to, actualand forecasted weather conditions, changes in commodity prices, changes in interest rates and other market factors. See Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” for sensitivity analysis and Item 8, Note 14 tothe Consolidated Financial Statements.

     5) Other Than Temporary Declines in Investments

     The Company's process for identifying declines in the fair value of investments that are other than temporary involves consideration of several factors. These factors include (i) the timeperiod during which there has been a significant decline in value, (ii) an analysis of the liquidity, business prospects and financial condition of the issuer, (iii) the significance of the decline, (iv) an analysis of the collateral structure andother credit support, as applicable, of the securities in question and (v) the Company's intent and ability to hold the investment for a sufficient period of time for the value to recover. Where the Company's analysis of the above factorsresults in the Company's conclusion that declines in fair values are other than temporary, the cost of the security is written down to fair value and the previously unrealized loss is therefore realized in the period such determination ismade.

     With respect to securities where the decline in value is determined to be temporary and the security's value is not written down, a subsequent decision may be made to sell that securityand realize a loss. Subsequent decisions on security sales are made within the context of overall risk monitoring, changing information, market conditions generally and assessing value relative to other comparable securities. Day-to-day managementof the Company's investment portfolio is outsourced to third party investment managers. While these investment managers may, at a given point in time, believe that the preferred course of action is to hold securities with unrealized losses thatare considered temporary until such losses are recovered, the dynamic nature of the portfolio management may result in a subsequent decision to sell the security and realize the loss, based upon a change in market and other factors described above.The Company believes that subsequent decisions to sell such securities are consistent with the classification of the Company's portfolio as available for sale.

     As mentioned above, the Company considers its intent and ability to hold a security until the value recovers as part of the process of evaluating whether a security's unrealized lossrepresents an other than temporary decline. However, this factor on its own does not dictate whether or not the Company recognizes an impairment charge. The Company believes its ability to hold such securities is supported by positive and sufficientcash flow from its operations and from maturities within its investment portfolio in order to meet its claims payment obligations arising from its underwriting operations without selling such investments. In this regard, cash flow from operatingactivities was $4.2 billion and $4.4 billion in 2005 and 2004, respectively.

     There are risks and uncertainties associated with determining whether declines in the fair value of investments are other than temporary. These include subsequent significant changes in generaleconomic conditions as well as specific business conditions affecting particular issuers, subjective assessment of issue-specific factors (seniority of claims, collateral value, etc.), future financial market effects, stability of foreigngovernments and economies, future rating agency actions and significant disclosure of accounting, fraud or corporate governance issues that may adversely affect certain investments. In addition, significant assumptions and management judgment areinvolved in determining if the decline is other than temporary. If management determines that a decline in fair value is temporary, then a security's value is not written down at that time. However, there are potential effects upon theCompany's future earnings and financial position should management later conclude that some of the current declines in the fair value of the investments are other than temporary declines. See “- Investment Activities - Unrealizedlosses on investments” for further information.

     6) Income Taxes

     The Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between thecarrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The Company has capitalized net operating tax losses of $238.1 million and $230.6 million against which a valuationallowance of $154.5 million and $68.6 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, has been established. The Company has capitalized realized and unrealized capital losses of $19.7 million and $7.7 million, respectively,against which a valuation allowance of $23.7 million at December 31, 2005 has been established. The deferral of benefits from tax losses is evaluated based upon management's estimates of the future profitability of the Company'staxable entities based on current forecasts, the character of income and the period for which losses may be carried forward. A valuation allowance may have to be established for any portion of a deferred tax asset that management believes will notbe realized. Should the future income of these entities fall below expectations, a further valuation allowance would have to be established, which could be significant. In addition, if any further losses are generated by these entities, these lossesmay not be tax affected.

     Effective as of January 1, 2004, XL Re America Inc (“XLRA”), a subsidiary of the Company, entered into an adverse development reinsurance treaty with another reinsurance subsidiary ofthe Company. The treaty related to the 1985 through (and including) 2000 underwriting years covering any adverse development on reserves calculated as of December 31, 2003 between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2005. The treaty has a limit of$500 million and limited loss development at XLRA relating to these underwriting years through December 31, 2005. Any commutation of this treaty requires the prior approval of the New York Department of Insurance. There is no impact of thistreaty on the consolidated financial statements of the Company; however, as part of management's continuing evaluation of its deferred tax asset, the treaty is critical in evaluating the future income position of the U.S. group of companies.Management believes that the treaty will protect the U.S. group from unexpected prior loss development. Absent unexpected loss development from the 2000 and prior underwriting years, management has concluded that there is sufficient positiveevidence of future profitability in the U.S. and that a valuation allowance as a charge against the deferred tax asset is not required at this time.

     For further information see “- Other Revenues and Expenses” and Item 8, Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

     7) Intangible Assets

     Intangible assets are carried at or below estimated fair value. There are many assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculation. Principally, the Company identifies the businessentity that the intangible asset is attributed to, and reviews historical and forecasted performance and other underlying factors affecting such analysis, including market conditions, premium rates and loss trends. Other assumptions used couldproduce a significantly different result which may result in a change in the value of the intangible asset and related amortization charge in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Based on the current expectations of profitability, an impairmentcharge would only be recognized in the event of a significant decline in the expected profitability of those operations where such intangible assets are applicable. At December 31, 2005, intangible assets were $1.8 billion of which approximately$1.4 billion and $0.4 billion related to the Company's reinsurance and insurance segments, respectively. See “ Other Revenue and Expenses” for further information.

     8) Variable Interest Entities

     The Company utilizes variable interest entities both directly and indirectly in the ordinary course of business. The Company must assess consolidation of variable interest entities based onwhether the Company is the primary beneficiary of the entity. The company that absorbs a majority of the expected losses or residual rewards of the entity is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and is therefore required to consolidate the entity.The determination of expected losses and expected residual returns requires the Company to estimate the expected cash flows of the entities

68


and measure the expected variability of these cash flows. The use of different assumptions to determine the expected cash flows and variability could affect the Company's determination of the primary beneficiary. Theassumptions used to determine the expected cash flows depend on the type of structure and the nature of the Company's variable interest. The Company has made assumptions primarily regarding default rates, the timing of defaults and recoveryrates to estimate these expected cash flows of the variable interest entities that it utilizes.

     9) Reinsurance Premium Estimates

     The Company writes business on both an excess of loss and proportional basis. In the case of excess of loss contracts, the subject written premium is generally outlined within the treaty andthe Company receives a minimum and/or deposit premium on a quarterly basis which is normally followed by an adjustment premium based on the ultimate subject premium for the contract. The Company estimates the premium written on the basis of theexpected subject premium and regularly reviews this against actual quarterly statements to revise the estimate based on the information provided by the cedent.

     On proportional contracts, written premiums are estimated to expected ultimate premiums based on information provided by the ceding companies. An estimate of premium is recorded at theinception of the contract. When the actual premium is reported by the ceding company, normally on a quarterly basis, it may be materially higher or lower than the estimate. Adjustments arising from the reporting of actual premium by the cedingcompanies are recorded in the period in which they are determined.

     Written premiums on excess of loss contracts are earned in accordance with the loss occurring period defined within the treaty, normally 12 months following inception of the contract. Writtenpremiums on proportional contracts are earned over the risk periods of the underlying policies issued and renewed, normally 24 months. For both excess of loss and proportional contracts, the earned premium is recognized ratably over the earningperiod, namely 12 - 24 months. The portion of the premium related to the unexpired portion of the policy at the end of any reporting period is reflected in unearned premiums.

     Reinsurance operations by their nature add further complications in that generally the ultimate premium due under a specific contract will not be known at the time the contract is entered into.As a result, more judgment and ongoing monitoring is required to establish premiums written and earned in the Company's reinsurance operations.

     Reinstatement premiums are recognized at the time a loss event occurs where coverage limits for the remaining life of the contract are reinstated under pre-defined contract terms and are fullyearned when recognized. Accrual of reinstatement premiums is based on the Company's estimate of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, which involves management judgment as described below.

Segments

     The Company operates through three business segments: Insurance, Reinsurance and Financial Products and Services. These business segments were determined in accordance with FAS No. 131,
“Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information”.


     The Company's segment results have been significantly impacted by the catastrophe loss events of 2005 and 2004, as noted above. These should be considered when making period to periodcomparisons of segment results.

     Following changes in certain executive management responsibilities in January 2005, the Company changed the reporting segments under which certain business units are reported in order toreflect these changes in responsibilities.

     The following areas have been changed for all periods presented:

Results of business structured by XL Financial SolutionsLtd (“XLFS”) are now included entirely within
 theFinancial Products and Services segment whereas previously this unit was  reportedin all three segments, depending on the natureof individual contracts.


69


Certain blocks of U.S.-based term life mortality reinsurancebusiness previously included in the Financial
 Productsand Services segment are now included in the Reinsurance segment as  managementof these contracts was transferred to the lifereinsurance business units in order to centralize the Company's managementof traditional mortality-based  reinsurance business.

Political risk insurance business units now report to executive management of the Financial Products and
 Services segment and, as such, future earnings from this business will no longer bereported in the
 Insurance segment but included with financial operations.

All operations of business units within the Financial Products and Services segment, including guaranteed
 investment contracts and funding agreements, are now reported under financialoperations in order to consolidate businesses with similar operating characteristics and risks.

All net investment income and net income from affiliates generated by assets and interest expense incurred
 on liabilities of the business units within the Financial Products and Servicessegment is reported under
 financial operations. This income and expense is included in financial operations as it relates to interest on
 portfolios of separately identified andmanaged assets and deposit liabilities. Management believes this
 change will better reflect the nature of spread focused business.


     In addition, the Company has changed its presentation of certain credit derivatives and now records premiums received from sales of these derivatives in gross written premiums and establishesunearned premium reserves and loss reserves for its investment grade credit derivative business. Previously, all components of the Company's consolidated statements of income impact related to credit default swaps had been reported on one line,“Net Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Derivative Instruments.” Prior periods have been re-presented for consistency in presentation.

     The Company's business is conducted on a global basis where several of its subsidiaries operate in foreign currencies which are the base currency of that entity. Under U.S. GAAP, revenuesand expenses of those operations are translated into the U.S. dollar at average exchange rates during the year and assets and liabilities at exchange rates at the end of the year.

     Gross and net premiums written decreased by 2.3% and 3.4%, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2005 compared with the year ended December 31, 2004. These decreases were primarily dueto continued competitive pricing across most lines, most notably property. Decreases were partially offset by continued growth in the

70


newer select and design professional and U.S. primary casualty units, and the impact of foreign exchange movements on premiums. Net premiums written declined in line with gross premiums written combined with increased cededreinstatement premiums payable as a result of the catastrophe activity in the year.

     Increases in gross and net premiums written in 2004 as compared to 2003 were primarily due to new business in the casualty and professional lines, multi-year contracts written in the year andfavorable foreign exchange movements. The most significant growth was due to new business product offerings in the areas of primary casualty, specialty professional and property catastrophe risks. Partially offsetting the growth in gross and netpremiums written in 2004 were rate reductions in most property and professional lines as well as growing rate pressures on most casualty lines during 2004.

     Net premiums earned increased by 1.2% in 2005 compared with 2004. Growth in net premiums earned is primarily as a result of the earn-out of net premiums written in 2004, including the newerbusiness initiatives mentioned above and increased net retentions. This growth was partially offset by the decreased volume in 2005, noted above, and net $89.1 million ceded reinstatement premiums as a result of the natural catastrophes in2005.

     Net premiums earned increased in each of the two years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 due to the increases in net premiums written in each year, as noted above. Growth in net premiums earnedin 2004 and 2003 were partially offset by several non-renewed portfolios as the earned premium impact of the non-renewed business lags behind the written premium impact.

     Fee income and other decreased in 2005 compared to 2004 and increased in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to the income recorded on the sale of property in London in 2004, combined withfees generated by the Company's professional lines start up businesses for administration of third party portfolios.

     Exchange gains are primarily generated by movement in foreign exchange rates applied to loss reserves held in currencies other than the functional currency of the reporting subsidiary. The gainin 2003 was partially reduced by a hedge put in place by the Company in February 2003 to cover part of its exposure to a U.K. sterling reinsurance recoverable balance.

     The decreases in the underwriting profit in 2005 as compared with 2004 and the decreases in 2004 as compared with 2003 were also reflective of the combined ratios, as shown below. The followingtable presents the ratios for the Insurance segment for each of the last three years ended December 31:

     The loss and loss expense ratio includes net losses incurred for both the current year and any adverse or favorable prior year development of loss and loss reserves held at the beginning of theyear.

     The loss and loss expense ratio for the Insurance segment for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased compared with the year ended December 31, 2004, primarily reflecting the net losses of$947.0 million incurred in the property catastrophe and property lines of business as a result of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma and the Other Cats combined with the impact of overall continued softening market conditions in 2005, losses of$834.2 million representing the unfavorable outcome of the independent actuarial process with WSIC and $185.8 million in net adverse prior year development.

     The loss and loss expense ratio for the Insurance segment for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased compared with the year ended December 31, 2003 primarily due to net hurricane losses of$298.3 million in the property and marine lines, combined with prior year reserve strengthening as discussed below, and losses and loss

71


expenses related to the South Asia Tsunami. Losses due to Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne combined with the South Asia Tsunami increased the loss ratio for the year by 7.5% .

     The Company did not change its methodology or key assumptions used in 2005, 2004 or 2003 to determine ultimate loss reserves for any line of insurance business written.

     Included in net adverse prior year development is the loss associated with the independent actuarial process with WSIC. The Independent Actuary's report concluded that WSIC'ssubmitted SNRA and NPRA were closest to the Independent Actuary's determinations of SNRA and NPRA. These determinations resulted in the Company receiving a net lump sum payment in the amount of approximately $575.0 million (includinginterest receivable) from WSIC. As the Company had recorded $1.4 billion in unpaid losses and loss expenses recoverable related to this protection, incurred losses of approximately $834.2 million were recorded in the fourth quarter of2005.

     During 2005, the Insurance segment's net adverse prior year development, excluding the impact of the result of the independent actuarial process, of $185.8 million was driven primarilyby increases in reported case reserves for excess professional liability. Strengthening of $259.5 million in professional lines was caused primarily by the establishment of case reserves on both directors' and officers' claims inpre-2002 business, and errors and omissions claims. Strengthening of $34.7 million within other specialty lines was caused primarily by increases in reported losses for specialty lines of business currently in run-off including certainLloyd's business, discontinued programs business, and surety. A net release of $112.5 million for global risk lines of business was driven by the reduction in case reserves for pre-2002 claims primarily relating to casualty business writtenout of Europe.

     During 2004, the segment's net adverse development of $292.0 million was driven primarily by increases in reported case reserves for excess professional liability, excess casualtyliability and specialty lines. These increases in reported case reserves exceeded the Company's expected losses based on historical patterns of loss development. Strengthening of $144.0 million in professional lines was caused by a fewlarge directors' and officers' claims in pre-2002 business, while increases in errors and omissions reserves were caused by loss related to large accounting firms and insurance and reinsurance brokers. For specialty lines, strengthening of$135.0 million was caused by reported loss increases in discontinued programs business with workers' compensation exposure, environmental related coverages, certain Lloyd's business and high severity claims on the suretybook.

     During 2004 and 2003, the Company's net adverse development of its gross reserves greatly exceeded its net reserve adverse development due principally to an increase in prior year reservesrelated to Winterthur International. The Company had protection with respect to any adverse loss or premium development related to the acquired Winterthur International insurance operations with effect from July 1, 2001, under the SPA with WSIC, andrecorded a recoverable of the same amount.

     There is no assurance that conditions and trends that have affected the development of liabilities in the past will continue. Accordingly, it is not appropriate to extrapolate futureredundancies or deficiencies based on the Company's historical results.

     The underwriting expense ratio for the year ended December 31, 2005 decreased compared with the same period in 2004 as a result of a decrease in the operating expense ratio of 0.5 points (12.6%as compared to 13.1%) combined with a decrease in the acquisition expense ratio of 0.8 points (12.4% as compared to 13.2%) . The reduction in the operating expense ratio was due to productivity expense management initiatives and certain compensationcost adjustments. The reduction in the acquisition expense ratio was due primarily to a change in the commission structure with certain brokers, partially offset by the impact of ceded reinstatement premiums.

     The underwriting expense ratio for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the same period in 2003 increased slightly. The decrease in the acquisition expense ratio of 1.6 points (13.3% ascompared to 14.9%) was offset by an increase in the operating expense ratio of 1.8 points (13.1% as compared to 11.3%) . The reduction in the acquisition expense ratio was due primarily to a change in the mix of business earned compared to the sameperiod in the prior year and changes in the commission structure with certain brokers. The increase in the operating expense ratio was due primarily to the increased costs associated with supporting new business growth in the segment operationsglobally, including start up operations, an allocation of certain corporate expenses to the Insurance segment and the impact of foreign exchange movements.

     Gross and net premiums written decreased by 1.3% and 3.4%, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Selective underwriting, ratereductions across most lines, and increased retentions by ceding companies, were partially offset by new proportional Lloyd's treaties as well as significant written and ceded reinstatement premiums related to the 2005 catastrophes. Pricereductions were most notable in casualty and professional lines. The rate improvements noted in late 2004 increased further subsequent to the 2005 Hurricane season in catastrophe exposed lines. Favorable foreign exchange movements also partiallyoffset the decrease in gross premiums written. Net premiums written reflect the above gross changes.

     Gross premiums written increased slightly for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to 2003. Most lines of business remained relatively flat as a result of rate decreases being offset byselective new premium volume growth. Casualty rates have remained stronger than the shorter tail lines of business. The high frequency of catastrophic events prompted some stabilization of rates in the property catastrophe business most impacted bythe losses, namely in Florida, in the latter half of the year. In addition, the increasingly competitive market has resulted in the non-renewal of certain Latin American property programs. Favorable foreign exchange movements also contributed$107.3 million to the growth in gross premiums written. Net premiums written reflect the above gross changes, together with higher retentions, offset by the effects of retrocessional reinstatement premiums and growth in certain largeproportional programs that are largely retroceded.

     Net premiums earned in the year ended December 31, 2005 decreased 5.5% compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, due primarily to the earn-out of the impact of rate pressures seen in grosspremiums.

     Net premiums earned in 2004 increased 18.4% as compared to 2003 due primarily to the earning of net written premium growth over the last several years, most notably in casualty and professionallines of business. Net premiums earned for casualty and professional reinsurance lines combined were $1.2 billion in 2004 as compared to $971.2 million in 2003.

     The loss and loss expense ratio includes net losses incurred for both the current year and any adverse or favorable prior year development of loss reserves held at the beginning of theyear.

     The increase in the loss and loss expense ratio in the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the same period in 2004, primarily reflected the effects of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilmacombined with the Other Cats from which the Reinsurance segment incurred a combined $977.9 million of net losses. These natural catastrophes added 34.4% to the segment loss ratio for the year ended December 31, 2005. In addition, there washigher than expected adverse prior year development of $93.5 million relating to primarily U.S. casualty business partially offset by reserve releases in short tail lines, as discussed further below.

     The decrease in the loss and loss expense ratio for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the same period in 2003 was primarily due to the fact that 2003 included significant adverseprior period development related to the Company's North American casualty business. See further discussion below. The Reinsurance segment experienced losses in 2004 resulting from Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne, from which thesegment incurred a combined $268.3 million of net losses and loss expenses. In addition, the segment incurred net losses and loss expenses of $24.6 million as a result of the earthquake and tsunami in South Asia. These large catastrophelosses contributed 10.0% to the segment loss ratio for the year ended December 31, 2004. Catastrophe losses were partially offset by lower than expected incurred loss development in the year relating to shorter tail lines prior underwriting yearsand price improvements on earned premiums from prior periods.

     During 2005, the Insurance segment's net adverse prior year development of $1.02 billion includes the results of the independent actuarial process noted above. Excluding thisdevelopment the remaining $185.8 million was driven primarily by increases in reported case reserves for excess professional liability. Strengthening of $259.5 million in professional lines was caused primarily by the establishment of casereserves on both directors' and officers' claims in pre-2002 business, and errors and omissions claims. Strengthening of $34.7 million within other specialty lines was caused primarily by increases in reported losses for specialtylines of business currently in run-off including certain Lloyd's business, discontinued programs business, and surety. A net release of $108.4 million for global risks lines of business was driven by the reduction in case reserves forpre-2002 claims primarily relating to casualty business written out of Europe.

     During 2005, net prior year reserves across the Reinsurance segment developed adversely by $93.5 million. Reserve strengthening of $266.9 million in casualty and professional lines waspartially offset by releases in other lines of business of $173.4 million. The casualty strengthening is primarily attributable to workers' compensation, umbrella liability and certain professional lines of business written in theCompany's North American operations. The reserve releases relate primarily to the property line where releases of $135.6 million occurred across all business units globally in the 2002 to 2004 underwriting years. Releases also occurred inthe marine and aviation classes of business across the reinsurance segment.

     The remainder of the strengthening in the casualty and professional lines reserves was driven by a small number of increases in reported claims in the other liability and errors and omissionslines of business in the pre-1997 underwriting years as well as recently reported claims in umbrella liability, errors and omissions and directors' and officers' lines of business in the 1997-2001 underwriting years. The professional linesclaims activity arises largely from a limited number of cedents. This reserve increase was partially offset by favorable development in the 1997- 2001 underwriting years in the medical malpractice business line. Activity in the post-2001underwriting years relates primarily to certain large individual claims affecting a number of lines, including surety, umbrella liability and errors and omissions.

     During 2004, net prior year reserves across the Reinsurance segment developed favorably by $24 million. Releases of $144 million in the property, aviation, marine and other lines ofbusiness were partially offset by strengthening of casualty and accident and health reserves amounting to approximately $122 million. Property catastrophe and property other reserve releases totaled approximately $95 million net relatedprimarily to the 2002 and 2003 underwriting years where loss experience has been exceptionally good for the property line. The strengthening of casualty reserves totaled $77 million and related most significantly to professional liabilityreserves which were strengthened by $32 million for Enron and Worldcom claims. The accident & health reserve strengthening of $45 million relates to a portfolio of business underwritten by certain of the Company'sLloyd's syndicates.

     During 2003, the Company increased its estimated reserves related to its reinsurance segment (excluding the September 11 event) by $996 million, of which approximately $877 millionrelated primarily to the Company's North American reinsurance operations for casualty business underwritten during the 1997 through 2001 underwriting years. The main lines of business affected by this adverse development included generalliability, medical malpractice, professional and surety lines. This adverse development was due to competitive market pressures on pricing during these underwriting years combined with an increase in the number and size of claims reported in recentyears as a result of increases in court filings, corporate scandals, rising tort costs and settlement awards. Prior year reserves also developed adversely on certain other casualty business written in the 1998 through 2001 underwriting years outsideof North America. These exposures were affected by trends similar to those as described above for the North American casualty reinsurance operations. The casualty exposures underwritten in these entities were much less than those of the NorthAmerican operations, so the impact on the prior year reserves was relatively smaller.

     In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company reduced aviation loss reserves related to the September 11 event by $197 million. This reduction in reserves was due to higher than expectedlevels of participation (97%) in the September 11 Victim Compensation Fund, a no-fault compensation scheme funded by the U.S. Government, which closed on December 22, 2003. This resulted in a reduction of the estimated ultimate losses by the Companyfor this event.

     The segment's reserving process includes a continuing evaluation of the potential impact on unpaid liabilities from exposure to asbestos and environmental claims, including related lossadjustment expenses. Liabilities are established to cover both known and incurred but not reported claims.

     A reconciliation of the opening and closing unpaid losses and loss expenses related to asbestos and environmental exposure claims related to business written prior to 1986 for the yearsindicated is as follows:

     Incurred but not reported losses, net of reinsurance, included in the above table was $16.7 million at December 31, 2005, $22.5 million at December 31, 2004 and $27.0 million atDecember 31, 2003. Unpaid losses recoverable are net of potential uncollectible amounts.

     The Company utilizes industry standard asbestos and environmental claims models to estimate its ultimate liability for these exposures.

     The Company reviews its actual reported loss experience for asbestos and environmental claims for its 1985 and prior exposures annually. The actual loss experience was consistent withassumptions established and, therefore, there was no adverse prior year development of the Company's asbestos and environmental reserves in 2004 or 2005. The reserves for these exposures represented less than 1% of the Company's totalunpaid loss and loss expense reserves at December 31, 2005.

     The Company believes it has made reasonable provision for its asbestos and environmental exposures and is unaware of any specific issues that would significantly affect its estimate for lossand loss expenses. For further information see Item 8, Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

     The decrease in the underwriting expense ratio in the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004, was due to a decrease in both the acquisition expenseratio and operating expense

76


ratio to 21.7% and 5.6%, respectively, as compared to 22.1% and 6.5%, respectively, for the year ended 2004. The decrease in the acquisition expense ratio was mainly due to decreased profit commissions, which resulted fromthe 2005 hurricane activity. The operating expense ratio decrease primarily reflects severance costs incurred during 2004 for reduction of staff as well as productivity expense management initiatives in 2005 and adjustments to certain 2005compensation costs.

     The decrease in the underwriting expense ratio for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared with 2003 was primarily due to a decrease in acquisition cost ratio driven by reduced profitcommissions as a result of the year's catastrophic losses. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the operating expense ratio resulting from additional allocations of corporate expenses as well as the adverse impact of foreignexchange.

     Exchange losses in the year ended December 31, 2005 were mainly attributable to an overall strengthening in the value of the U.S. dollar against U.K. Sterling and the Euro in thoseoperations' unpaid losses in non-U.S. dollar currencies. Exchange gains in 2004 and 2003 were mainly attributable to a decline in the value of the U.S. dollar against U.K. sterling and the Euro in Bermuda-based operations that write businessglobally.

*NM - Not meaningful
     Life and annuity gross and net premiums written, net premiums earned and claims and policy benefits in each of the three years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 included the assumption ofthe following long duration annuity portfolios:

     1. Second and fourth quarters of 2005 - A large U.K. immediate annuity portfolio contract bound representing $1.8 billion in net premiums earned and two smaller Irish immediate annuityportfolios amounted to $96.2 million.

     2. Second and fourth quarters of 2004 - Two large U.K. portfolio contracts, representing $995 million in net premiums earned and related claims and policy benefits.

     3. Fourth quarter of 2003 - two portfolios, one U.K. and one Irish, for a total of approximately $395.5 million in net premiums earned and related claims and policy benefits.

     The Company acquired cash and investment assets related to the future policy benefit reserves assumed at inception of these large contracts. While the Company expects to write more of thesecontracts, the frequency of these transactions will likely continue to be irregular.

     Excluding these large contracts, net premiums earned in life and annuity reinsurance increased in 2005 compared with 2004 and 2004 compared with 2003, as the Company expanded its life andannuity reinsurance operations in Europe, and continues to bind additional regular premium term assurance contracts which generate ongoing premiums.

     Claims and policy benefits also increased significantly in 2005 as compared to 2004, as a result of the annuity payout liabilities accepted under the contracts noted above where investmentassets were acquired with the assumption of the policy benefit reserves at the inception of the contract. In addition, $37.4 million in losses were recorded during the second quarter of 2005 related to certain novated blocks of U.S.-based termlife mortality reinsurance business as a result of the actuarially modeled impact of actual paid losses being greater than expected. In accordance with U.S. GAAP treatment for life business, a loss recognition test process was carried out todetermine if expected future premiums would be sufficient to pay for expected future losses. This process led to management's decision to unlock the current policy benefit reserve ratio and record a loss.

     Acquisition costs increased in the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 reflecting the write-off of certain deferred costs of $25.9 million,including value of business assumed related to the U.S. mortality business noted above, as current profit projections did not support the recovery of the deferred costs booked in the prior year. Operating expenses increased in 2005 compared to 2004due to build-out of existing operations and start-up costs of new life operations in the U.S.

     Net investment income has increased reflecting the increase in life business invested assets primarily arising from new large annuity contracts written since 2004. Net investment income isincluded in the calculation of net income from life and annuity operations as it relates to income earned on portfolios of separately identified and managed life investment assets and other allocated assets. The accretion of the related futurepolicy benefit reserves is included in claims and policy benefits.

     Increases in gross and net premiums written of 9.5% in 2005, as compared to 2004, were primarily due to additional premiums due in 2005 on a structured property and casualty policy, whichincurred a loss related to Hurricane Katrina, as well as premiums from several new structured property and casualty policies written during the year. Financial guaranty premiums remained relatively flat in 2005, as compared to 2004.

     Decreases in gross and net premiums written of 4.2% and 7.2%, respectively, in 2004, as compared to 2003, were primarily due to lower financial guaranty premiums written, resulting frommanagement's underwriting and pricing discipline during generally weaker market conditions in 2004. In addition, during 2004 there were fewer large up-front premium contracts written, as compared with the prior year. Financial guaranty marketconditions in 2004, as compared to 2003 were characterized by tighter credit spread compression, higher interest rates, increased competition and reduced public financing volume.

     Financial guaranty up-front premiums are earned over the life of the insured debt obligations based on par amount of risk outstanding. Financial guaranty installment premiums are earned overthe installment period. Premiums from structured property and casualty and political risk business are generally earned over the period of coverage.

     The following table provides a line of business breakdown of the Financial Products and Services segment's net premiums earned:

(1)      Includes structured property and casualty and alternative risk transfer products and weather and energy risk management products.
     The increase in net premiums earned of 11.0% during 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily resulted from additional premiums due in 2005 on a structured property and casualty policy whichincurred a loss related to Hurricane Katrina, as well as new structured property and casualty business production in 2005, offset in part by lower earned premium in our financial guaranty line of business in 2005, as compared to 2004. The yearover year decrease in earnings in our financial guaranty line of business was primarily attributable to $23.3 million of premium earnings recorded in 2004 relating to an insured project financing on which a full-limit loss was recognized duringthe year (for further discussion see “Net losses and loss expenses” below).

     The increase in net premiums earned in 2004, as compared to the prior year, was primarily due to growth in the financial guaranty in force book of business, in conjunction with the accelerationof $23.3 million in premium earnings on the insured project financing discussed above (for further discussion see “Net losses and loss expenses” below). This increase was partially offset by the impact on earned premiums in 2003related to the refunding of certain insured financings and certain short term contract enhancements.

     Net losses and loss expenses include current year net losses incurred and adverse or favorable development of prior year reserves for net losses and loss expenses. Net losses and loss expensesduring 2005 decreased by 7.5%, as compared to 2004. This decrease primarily resulted from lower incurred losses in the Company's financial guaranty business of approximately $65.8 million due primarily to the absence of significantindividual losses as compared to the prior year, as well as favorable development associated with the Company's unallocated loss reserves, partially offset by an increase in loss reserves in our structured property and casualty business ofapproximately $50.4 million that primarily resulted from a limit loss incurred under a contract related to Hurricane Katrina.

     Net losses and loss expenses in 2004 increased by 14.1% compared to 2003. The increase was primarily the result of a provision for losses in 2004 of approximately $41.7 million relating tothe subordinate layer of an insured

79


project financing structure, as well as a net increase in unallocated reserves resulting from the growth in financial guaranty in force business, offset by a decrease in reserves in 2004, as compared to 2003, relating tonon-investment grade credit default swaps of approximately $37.4 million.

     For 2005, acquisition costs decreased by approximately $0.4 million. This decrease consisted of higher acquisition expenses in our guaranteed investment contract and funding agreementbusinesses, offset by lower acquisition expenses in our financial guaranty business. Lower acquisition expenses in our financial guaranty business were primarily the result of ceding proportionally more installment business relative to upfrontbusiness in 2005, as compared to 2004. Risk on installment business generally expires faster than that on upfront business, which resulted in a higher year over year amortization of deferred commissions. For 2004 acquisition costs decreased comparedwith 2003 reflecting a change in the average life of the financial guaranty in force book of business over which such costs are expensed.

     For 2005, net operating expenses, including non-structured and structured products, were $113.6 million, a decrease of $6.6 million from $120.2 million in 2004. The favorablemovement was mostly attributable to a reduction in compensation expense and professional fees. For 2004, net operating expenses, including non-structured and structured products, increased by $32.2 million to $120.2 million from $88.0million for 2003 due primarily to the investment in segment infrastructure and continued build-out of the financial products platform as well as an increase in the allocation of certain corporate expenses.

     Net investment income related to the financial guaranty business increased by 76.0% in 2005, as compared to 2004, due primarily to higher average invested assets resulting from net cash inflowsfrom operations and a $125.0 million capital infusion during the fourth quarter of 2004. In addition, $16.3 million in investment income (including a special one-time dividend paid in 2005 of $9.9 million) relates to the Company'sinvestment in Financial Security Assurance International Ltd. (“FSAI”). The special dividend was paid in connection with the redemption of the Company's investment in FSAI during December of 2005. Prior to October 1, 2004, thisinvestment in FSAI was accounted for under the equity method and reported the associated results thereof in “Net income from financial and investment affiliates”. Effective October 1, 2004, the Company changed the accounting for itsinvestment in FSAI from the equity method to FSAB 115, 
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities 

to conform to the requirements of EITF 02-14
Whether an Investor Should Apply the Equity Method of Accounting to Investments Other Than Common Stock 

(“EITF 02-14”). Accordingly, beginning October 1, 2004 theonly earnings recognized by the Company on its investment in FSAI were dividends that were reported in investment income.

     Net investment income related to the financial guaranty business increased by 75.2% in 2004, as compared to 2003, due primarily to higher average invested assets resulting from net cash inflowsfrom operations and a $100.0 million capital infusion to this business in the fourth quarter of 2003.

     Net investment income related to structured products increased by 80.2% in 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily as a result of a significant increase in average funding agreement and guaranteedinvestment contract deposits from $2.8 billion in 2004 to $4.9 billion in 2005. Similarly, net investment income related to structured products increased 55.7% in 2004, as compared to 2003, due to an increase in average funding agreement andguaranteed investment contract deposits from $1.1 billion in 2003 to $2.8 billion in 2004.

     Interest expense on structured products relates to deposit liabilities associated with funding agreements, guaranteed investment contracts and certain structured property and casualtycontracts. The increase in interest expense during 2005, as compared to 2004, related primarily to the increase in the average funding agreement and guaranteed investment contract deposits in 2005 discussed above, partially offset by reducedinterest expense on certain structured property and casualty contracts resulting from a change in the timing of estimated future cash outflows from such contracts during 2005.

     Net income from financial affiliates includes earnings on the Company's investment in Primus Guaranty, Ltd (“Primus”) and certain of the Company's investment affiliates,which are accounted for under the equity method. The decrease in such earnings in 2005, as compared to 2004, was due primarily to a decrease in earnings from Primus, as

80


well as the change in accounting related to the Company's investment in FSAI to conform with the requirements of EITF 02-14 as discussed above. Primus specializes in providing credit risk protection through creditderivatives. Net income from financial affiliates also decreased in 2004, as compared to 2003, due primarily to the Company's investment in Primus. Primus had a mark-to-market adjustment in 2004, which was less favorable than that recorded in2003. This decrease was partially offset by income from the sale of a portion of the Company's investment in Primus, in connection with the initial public offering of Primus in the fourth quarter of 2004.

     Minority interest in 2005 is consistent with 2004. The decrease in minority interest in 2004, as compared to 2003, reflects the fact that the minority interest holder's return oninvestment is contractually capped. The minority interest relates to an equity position in XL Financial Assurance Ltd., which is held by a third party.

     Net results from structured derivatives represent changes in the market value of the segment's insured credit derivative portfolio, as well as results from its weather and energyderivative business and certain structured financial risk management products. Net results from structured derivatives decreased 8.2% in 2005, as compared to 2004. Results in 2005 primarily consist of (i) $8.2 million of unrealized gainsresulting from the reclassification to “net losses and loss expenses” of an incurred loss on a credit default swap, (ii) an $18.6 million gain on the settlement of a structured market risk management derivative product tied to ahousing price index, and (iii) $17.8 million net realized and unrealized gains in the weather and energy business. Results in 2004 primarily consist of (i) net unrealized gains on the credit derivative portfolio of $44.2 million resultingprimarily from tightening credit spreads during the year, (ii) $3.3 million of net realized and unrealized gains on the structured financial derivative business, and (iii) $2.0 million of net realized and unrealized gains in the weather andenergy business.

        Net income from investment affiliates in 2004 and 2005 reflect the twelve months to November 30, 2004 and 2005, as compared to the eleven months ended November 30, 2003. The Company records the investment affiliates on aone month lag in order for the Company to meet the accelerated filing deadlines as specified by the SEC.

     Net investment income related to general operations increased in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to growth in the investment base, as well as increases in the yield of the portfolio. Thegrowth in the investment base reflected the Company's cash flow from operations. The Company also received a distribution associated with the unwinding of a collateral debt obligation, which resulted in a one-time benefit to investment income.In addition, the Company received investment income of $25.3 million on related to the conclusion of the independent actuarial process with WSIC.

     The Company's total investments available for sale and cash and cash equivalents less net pending payable for investments purchased was $38.8 billion at December 31, 2005 as comparedto $29.8 billion at December 31, 2004. This increase of $9.0 billion includes (i) cash flow from financing activities of $3.2 billion in the fourth quarter of

81


2005, (ii) cash flow of $2.0 billion from spread product transactions and (iii) cash flow from operations of $4.2 billion. The annualized effective yield of the total investment portfolio (excluding non-recurringitems) was 4.1% for 2005 as compared to 3.8% for 2004, a 0.3% increase. The increase in the effective yield of the total investment portfolio was primarily due to general interest rate increases in the U.S.

     It is expected that net investment income in 2006 will increase due to projected increases in investments resulting from the full year effect of investing proceeds from the December 2005capital raise, and monies received from conclusion of the independent actuarial process with WSIC, as well as anticipated increases in market yields on reinvestment of existing assets and investment of new cash flows. However, actual market changesin interest rates could offset or supplement the effects of cash flow. For a further discussion see “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

     Net income from investment affiliates includes earnings from the Company's investments in closed-end investment funds and partnerships and similar vehicles that are equity accounted. Netincome from investment affiliates increased in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to a strong result in private equity portfolios due to a series of positive liquidity events, with continued good returns on the alternative portfolios.

     Investment Performance

     The Company manages its investment grade fixed income securities using an asset/liability management framework. Due to the unique nature of the underlying liabilities, customized benchmarks areused to measure investment performance and comparison to standard market indices is not meaningful. Investment performance is not monitored for certain assets primarily consisting of operating cash and special regulatory deposits. The following is asummary of the investment portfolio returns for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 of the general account asset/liability portfolio, structured and spread product portfolio and risk asset portfolios.

        Portfolio returns are calculated by dividing the sum of the net investment income or net income from investment affiliates, realized gains (losses) and unrealized gains (losses) by the average market value of eachportfolio. Non U.S. dollar fixed income performance is measured in either the underlying currency or in U.S. dollars.


 


Net realized gains and losses on investments and other than temporary declines in the value of investments


     The Company's investment portfolio is classified as available for sale. Realized investment gains and losses occur through the normal turnover of the Company's investment portfolio.Realized investment losses include impairment charges relating to declines in value of securities that are considered to be other than temporary. See “- Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” for further information.

     In 2005, net realized gains on investments were $241.9 million which includes $250.8 million of gross realized losses on fixed income and $54.1 million of gross realized losses onequity securities. Gross realized losses in 2005

82


included $53.2 million of provisions for declines in fair value considered to be other than temporary. In the U.S., the general level of corporate defaults was stable. For example, Moody's Investors Service, Inc.(“Moody's”) reported that 31 issuers defaulted in 2005 compared with 34 issuers in 2004 and 77 issuers in 2003. The Company's exposure to these defaults was limited in both 2005 and 2004, compared to 2003, resulting in areduction in the write-down for other than temporary declines. As a percentage of the total fixed income portfolio, the write-down for other than temporary declines was 0.1% in 2005 as compared to a negligible amount in 2004 and 0.6% in2003.

     In 2004, net realized gains on investments were $246.5 million which includes $265.9 million of gross realized losses on fixed income and $48.8 million of gross realized losses onequity securities. Gross realized losses in 2004 included $6.4 million of provisions for declines in fair value considered to be other than temporary.

     In 2003, net realized gains on investments were $120.2 million, which included $344.8 million of gross realized losses on fixed income and $162.5 million of gross realized losses onequity securities. Gross realized losses in 2003 included $130.7 million of provisions for declines in fair value considered to be other than temporary.

     With respect to those securities that were sold at a loss during the year ended December 31, 2005, the following is an analysis of the period of time that those securities had been in acontinual unrealized loss position, the amount of the realized loss recorded in the Company's results of operations as of the sale date and the amount of the impairment charge taken in the year:

     The Company's process for identifying declines in the fair value of investments that are other than temporary involves consideration of several factors, as discussed under “CriticalAccounting Policies and Estimates.”

     During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company realized losses of $250.8 million and $54.1 million upon the sale of fixed income securities and equity securities, respectively,that had been in an unrealized loss position for greater than twelve months. During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company realized losses of $18.9 million and $3.3 million upon the sale of fixed income securities and equitysecurities, respectively, that had been in an unrealized loss position for greater than twelve months. The decisions to sell these securities were made by the Company's investment managers based upon a change in market conditions and otherfactors (these decisions were independent of the Company's previously stated intent and ability to hold such securities).

     Net realized and unrealized gains on investment derivatives result from the Company's investment strategy to economically hedge against interest and foreign exchange risk within theinvestment portfolio. For a further discussion see Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” and “- Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

     Unrealized losses on investments

     At December 31, 2005, there were $312.7 million of gross unrealized losses on fixed income and short-term investments, and $8.8 million of gross unrealized losses on equity securities.At December 31, 2004, there were $119.7 million of gross unrealized losses on fixed-income and short-term investments, and $7.2 million of gross unrealized losses on equity securities. These losses include securities below investment grade,as discussed below.

     The information shown below about the unrealized losses on the Company's investments at December 31, 2005 and 2004, concerns the potential effect upon future earnings and financialposition should management later conclude that some of the current declines in the fair value of these investments are other than temporary declines.

     The following is an analysis of the length of time each of those investment securities at December 31, 2005 and 2004 had been in a continual unrealized loss position:

*NM - Not meaningful
     In 2005, net income from operating affiliates declined over 2004, which resulted from the fact that the 2004 results included proceeds from the sale of two affiliates, as described below. Theresults of the Company's investment management affiliates showed good underlying growth in 2005 due to good investment performance and growth in assets managed by these minority-owned managers.

     In 2004, the increase in net income from operating affiliates included strong performance by the Company's investment management affiliates combined with income of $66.7 million on thesale of the Company's investment in the Admiral Group Ltd. and $35.4 million of income from the sale of the Company's stake in Pareto Partners L.P. and its affiliated companies, as well as strong growth in assets managed by theseminority-owned managers.

     Net income from operating affiliates in 2003 included an other than temporary decline of $40.9 million in the value of the Company's investment in Annuity and Life Reinsurance Company.The investment was written down to its fair value of $2.2 million at March 31, 2003. See Item 8, Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

     Amortization of intangible assets decreased in 2005 as a result of certain intangible assets that were fully amortized during the year. Amortization of intangible assets increased in 2004 ascompared to 2003 due primarily to the acquisition of a book of business related to XL Re Europe at the end of 2003.

     Corporate operating expenses in 2005 decreased by 10.0% primarily as a result of Company-wide cost reduction efforts combined with reduced compensation costs and partially offset by increasedlegal costs. Corporate operating expenses in 2004 increased 35.5% compared to 2003 due to the continued build-out of the Company's global infrastructure and personnel in developing its network of shared service organizations to supportoperations in certain locations, costs related to compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and adverse foreign exchange impacts.

     Interest expense includes costs related to the Company's debt and collateral facilities as well as deposit liability accretion. The increase in interest expense primarily reflected theincrease in average outstanding debt for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to 2004. For more information on the Company's financial structure, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources”.

     In 2004, interest expense has increased primarily as a result of the additional interest related to the senior notes issued in March, August and November of 2004, partially offset by thereduced interest as a result of the redemption of the Liquid Yield Option Notes and Zero Coupon Convertible Debentures during that year.

     The change in the Company's income taxes in each of the three years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 principally reflects the effects of changes in the profitability of the U.S. andEuropean operations for each year. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 decreased from 2004, due primarily to losses incurred in the Company's U.S. operations as a result of the 2005 catastrophe activity. A significantproportion of the loss reserve increases are captured in non-U.S. subsidiaries where no tax relief is available.

     The deferral of tax losses is evaluated based upon the future profitability of the Company's taxable entities and, under current projections, the Company anticipates using this asset. TheCompany's net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2005 was $318.4 million, which consists primarily of net operating losses generated by subsidiaries in the U.S. and U.K. Should the taxable income of these entities fall below expectations, afurther valuation allowance may have to be established, which could be significant. In addition, if any further losses are generated by these entities, these losses may not be tax effected. See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates”and Item 8, Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

     Investments

     While the Company reviews the adequacy of established reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses regularly, no assurance can be given that actual claims made and payments related thereto willnot be in excess of the amounts reserved. In the future, if such reserves develop adversely, such deficiency would have a negative impact on future results of operations. See Item 1, “Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses”, “CriticalAccounting Policies and Estimates” and Item 8, Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses Recoverable and Reinsurance Balances Receivable


     In the normal course of business, the Company seeks to reduce the potential amount of loss arising from claims events by reinsuring certain levels of risk assumed in various areas of exposurewith other insurers or reinsurers. While reinsurance agreements are designed to limit the Company's losses from large exposures and permit recovery of a portion of direct unpaid losses, reinsurance does not relieve the Company of its ultimateliability to the Company's insureds. Accordingly, the losses and loss expense reserves on the balance sheet represent the Company's total unpaid gross losses. Unpaid losses and loss expense recoverable relates to estimated reinsurancerecoveries on the unpaid loss and loss expense reserves.

     Unpaid losses and loss expense recoverables were $6.4 billion and $7.0 billion at December 31, 2005, and 2004, respectively. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, reinsurance balancesreceivable were $1.0 and $1.1 billion, respectively. The table below presents the Company's net reinsurance recoverable at December 31, 2005 and 2004.

     The Company has credit risk should any of its reinsurers be unable or unwilling to settle amounts due. Of the $7.5 billion total unpaid losses and loss expenses recoverable and reinsurancebalances receivable at December 31, 2005, no individual reinsurer accounted for 10% or more of the total. The Company is the beneficiary of letters of credit, trust accounts and funds withheld in the aggregate amount of $2.1 billion at December31, 2005, collateralizing reinsurance recoverables with respect to certain reinsurers. The provision for uncollectible reinsurance is required principally due to the failure of reinsurers to indemnify the Company primarily because of disputes underreinsurance contracts and insolvencies. As at December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had a reserve for potential non-recoveries from reinsurers of $260.7 million and $280.7 million, respectively.

     Included in unpaid loss and loss expenses recoverable at December 31, 2004, was an unsecured reinsurance recoverable from WSIC of $1.45 billion, related to certain contractual arrangementsin the SPA entered into in connection with the Company's acquisition of Winterthur International in July 2001. This balance was settled in 2005 for $575 million, resulting in a loss of $808.9 million, net of interestreceived.

     Under the terms of the SPA, WSIC provides the Company with protection with respect to third party reinsurance receivables and recoverables related to the acquisition of certain WinterthurInternational insurance operations (the “Winterthur Business”), which were approximately $1.6 billion, in the aggregate, as of December 31, 2005. There are two levels of protection for these balances:

       
        1.     

        At the time of the Winterthur International acquisition, WSIC provided to the Company a liquidity facility. At the time of the payment of the net reserve seasoned amount on December 12, 2005, the Company exercised its rightto repay up to the balances outstanding on this facility by assignment to WSIC of an equal amount of receivables relating to reinsurance recoverables selected by the Company. During December 2005, the Company assigned $265.4 million ofreceivables to WSIC under this arrangement, although WSIC has disputed the assignment of certain of these receivables.


 

   
        2.

        Under two retrocession agreements the Company has reinsurance protection on the reinsurance recoverables with respect to the Seasoned Net Reserves Amount determined as of June 30, 2004, to the extent that the Company doesnot receive payment of such amounts from applicable reinsurers with one agreement providing a limit of $1.3 billion for the insurance written in the period to June 30, 2001, and the other agreement providing a limit of $1.3 billion for theinsurance written in the period to December 31, 2000.



     At December 31, 2005, certain reinsurers responsible for some portions of the reinsurance of the acquired Winterthur Business have raised issues as to whether amounts claimed are due anddiscussions are currently ongoing to achieve a resolution.

     Approximately 76% of the total unpaid loss and loss expense recoverable and reinsurance balances receivable (excluding collateral held) outstanding at December 31, 2005, were due fromreinsurers rated “A” or better by S&P. The following is an analysis of the total recoverable and reinsurance balances receivable at December 31, 2005, by reinsurers owing more than 3% of such total:

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     As a holding company, the Company's assets consist primarily of its investments in subsidiaries, and the Company's future cash flows depend upon the availability of dividends or otherstatutorily permissible payments from its subsidiaries. The ability to pay such dividends is limited by the applicable laws and regulations of the various countries in which the Company operates, including, among others, Bermuda, the United States,Ireland, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and those of the Society of Lloyd's and certain contractual provisions. See Item 8, Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. No assurance can be given that the Company orits subsidiaries will be permitted to pay dividends in the future.

Liquidity

     Certain business written by the Company has loss experience generally characterized as having low frequency and high severity. This may result in volatility in both the Company's resultsand operational cash flows.

     See Item 8 - “Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.” There are three main sources of cash flows for the Company - those provided by operations, investing activities andfinancing activities.

      Cash Flow provided by Operations


     Cash flow from operations is derived from two main sources:

       
        1)     

        The receipt of investment income on the Company's total investment portfolio; and


 

   
        2)

        The net receipt of premiums less claims and expenses related to its underwriting activities in general, life and annuity and financial operations.



     Cash flow from operations was $4.2 billion in 2005, as compared to $4.4 billion in 2004. The decrease in 2005 is due primarily to cash payments on catastrophe losses during 2005,partially offset by the receipt of a net lump sum payment of $575.0 million from WSIC, related to the conclusion of the independent actuarial process and an increase in the receipt of investment income in line with increasing interest rates andthe growth of the investment portfolio.

     Net cash received from underwriting activities is comprised of receipt of premiums, minus payment of claims and operating and acquisition costs. Premiums and acquisition expenses are settledbased on terms of trade as stipulated by an underwriting contract, and generally are received within the first year of inception of a policy when the premium is written, but can be up to three years on certain reinsurance business assumed. Operatingexpenses are generally paid within a year of being incurred. Claims especially for casualty business, may take a much longer time before they are reported and ultimately settled and this is why the Company establishes reserves for unpaid lossesand

90


loss expenses. Therefore, the amount of claims paid in any one year is not necessarily related to the amount of net losses incurred, as reported in the consolidated statement of income.

     During 2005, 2004 and 2003, the total amounts of net losses paid for general and financial operations were $2.6 billion, $3.1 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, whereas the amount of netlosses incurred was $7.4 billion, $4.9 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively. The decrease in net paid losses in 2005, is due to the receipt of a net lump sum payment of approximately $575 million related to the conclusion of theindependent actuarial process with WSIC, partially offset by payments on 2005 Atlantic hurricane losses. The payout of the Company's casualty reserves at December 31, 2005, could be as long as a thirty year period. Property claims are generallyreported and settled within a much shorter period, usually up to three years.

Cash Flow used in Investing Activities

     Generally, positive cash flow from operations and financing activities is invested in the Company's portfolio, including affiliates or acquisition of subsidiaries. Investing activities in2005, were primarily related to the renewal purchase and sale of portfolio investments. In 2004, in addition to purchases and sales of the Company's total investment portfolio, the Company sold its interests in Admiral Group Ltd and ParetoPartners L.P. and its affiliated companies for $66.7 million and $45.1 million, respectively.

     In 2003, in addition to purchases and sales of the Company's total investment portfolio, the Company had the following significant investment cash flows:

       
        1)     

        In September 2003, the Company exercised its option and settled the related Euro liability to purchase the remaining 33% ownership of Le Mans RÉ, now known as XL Re Europe, for approximately $161million.


 

   
 
 See Item 8, Note 5(a) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.


 

   
        2)

        In December 2003, the Company received $75.4 million relating to the agreement reached with WSIC as to the final purchase price for Winterthur International. See Item 8, Note 5(b) to the Consolidated FinancialStatements for further information.


 

   
        3)

        In July 2003, the Company acquired new offices in London for its London headquarters. The acquisition was by a purchase, sale and leaseback transaction resulting in net cash received of $45.3 million, which was recordedas a deferred liability at December 31, 2003. The Company also recorded a capitalized lease asset and liability of approximately $150.0 million related to this transaction and there were no significant capital expenditures for leaseholdimprovements during 2003. See Item 8, Note 18(d) to the Consolidated Financial Statements.


 


Cash Flow provided by Financing Activities

     Cash flows related to financing activities include the payment of dividends, share related transactions, the issue or repayment of debt and deposit liability transactions. In 2005 and 2004, theCompany received $2.0 billion and $1.5 billion of net cash relating to new deposit liability contracts. In 2005, dividends paid were $276.7 million for ordinary shares and $40.3 million for preferred shares.

     In addition, in the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 the Company executed a number of debt and equity transactions which affect the cash flow from financing activities describedbelow in “Capital Resources”.

Capital Resources

     In addition to ordinary share capital, the Company depends on external sources of financing to support its underwriting activities in the form of:

       
        a.     

        ordinary share capital,


 

   
        b.

        debt,


 


91


       
        c.     

        preference shares,


 

   
        d.

        contingent capital, and


 

   
        e.

        letters of credit facilities and other sources of collateral.


 


In particular, the Company requires, among other things:
Sufficient capital to maintain its financial strength, claims paying and debt ratings, as issued by several
 ratings agencies, at levels considered necessary by management to enable theCompany's key operating
 subsidiaries to compete.

Sufficient capital to enable its underwriting subsidiaries to meet the capital adequacy tests performed by
 statutory agencies in the U.S., the U.K., and other key markets.

Letters of credit and other forms of collateral that are required by the Company's non-U.S. operating companies that are “non-admitted” under U.S. state insuranceregulations. The Company also uses letters of
 credit to support its operations at Lloyd's.

Revolving credit to meet short-term liquidity needs.


     The Company's principal credit facilities are multi-year transactions with maturities in 2007 and 2010, however, the Company has other credit facilities that will expire in 2006. Thefollowing risks are associated with the Company's requirement to renew these facilities during 2006:

The credit available from banks may be reduced resulting in the Company's need to pledge its investment
 portfolio to customers. This could result in a lower investment yield.

The volume of business that the Company's non-admitted subsidiaries are able to transact could be reduced
 if the Company is unable to renew its letter of credit facilities at anappropriate amount.


     Continued consolidation within the banking industry may result in the aggregate amount of credit provided to the Company being reduced. The Company attempts to mitigate this risk by identifyingand/or selecting additional banks that can participate in the credit facilities upon renewal.

a) Ordinary Share Capital

     In December 2005, the Company issued 38.9 million ordinary shares at a price of $65.0 per share to support capital requirements subsequent to the 2005 Atlantic hurricane losses and the lossrelated to the conclusion of the independent actuarial process with WSIC. The net proceeds from this issuance were $2.4 billion. See Item 8, Note 19, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

b) Debt

     At December 31, 2005, banks and investors provided the Company and its subsidiaries with $4.6 billion of debt capacity, of which $3.4 billion was utilized by the Company. Thesefacilities consist of:

Revolving credit facilities of $1.2 billion in aggregate. 

The Company had $45 million outstanding at
 December 31, 2005, under its syndicatedrevolving credit facilities and this borrowing was repaid in
 January 2006. These revolving credit facilities (and their predecessor facilities) were not utilized during
 2004. Of the$1.2 billion, $1.0 billion is provided by the Company's $2.0 billion 3-year syndicated facility
 that matures in June 2007, and its $2.35 billion 5-year syndicated facility that matures in June2010. Both
 facilities provide letters of credit in addition to the revolving credit sublimit. In addition, at December 31,
 2005, the Company had two bilateral revolving creditfacilities of $100 million each, of which one facility
 is a 364-day facility that matures in December 2006, and the other is a 5-year facility that matures in
 August2010.


92


At December 31, 2004, the Company had a $600 million revolving credit sublimit provided by a $2.0 billion 3-year facility and a $1.0 billion 364-day facility. In addition, afurther $60 million of revolving credit
 was provided on a bilateral basis under a 364-day facility. These facilities were provided on an unsecured
 basis by a syndicate of banks(the $2.0 billion and $1.0 billion facilities) and on a bilateral basis in the case
 of the $100 million facility.
Senior Unsecured Notes of approximately $3.4 billion. 

These notes require the Company to pay a fixed
 rate of interest during their lives. AtDecember 31, 2005, there were six outstanding issues of senior unsecured notes:

d) Contingent Capital

     In addition to funded debt transactions, the Company and a majority-owned subsidiary (XL Financial Assurance Ltd. (“XLFA”)) have entered into contingent capital transactions. Noup-front proceeds were received by the Company or XLFA under these transactions, however, in the event that the associated irrevocable put option agreements are exercised, proceeds previously raised from investors from the issuance of pass-throughtrust securities would be received in return for the issuance of preferred shares.

     On December 10, 2004, XLFA entered into a put option agreement and an asset trust expense reimbursement agreement with Twin Reefs Asset Trust (the “Asset Trust”). The put optionagreement provides XLFA with the irrevocable right to require the Asset Trust at any time and from time to time to purchase XLFA's non-cumulative perpetual Series B Preferred Shares with an aggregate liquidation preference of up to $200million. There is no limit to the number of times that XLFA may exercise the put option, redeem the Series B Preferred Shares from the Asset Trust and exercise the put option again. XLFA is obligated to reimburse the Asset Trust for certain fees andordinary expenses. To the extent that any Series B Preferred Shares are put to the Asset Trust and remain outstanding, a corresponding portion of such fees and ordinary expenses will be payable by XLFA pursuant to the asset trust expensereimbursement agreement. The put option agreement is perpetual but would terminate on delivery of notice by XLFA on or after December 9, 2009, or under certain defined circumstances, such as the failure of XLFA to pay the put option premium when dueor bankruptcy. The premium payable by XLFA is the sum of certain trustee and investment managers expenses, the distribution of income paid to holders of the pass-through trust securities, less the investment yield on the eligible assets purchasedusing the proceeds originally raised from the issuance of the pass-through securities.

     In July 2003, the Company entered into a contingent capital transaction with an aggregate value of $500.0 million. This transaction provides the Company with an insurance trust thatprovides the Company with statutory relief under state insurance regulations in the U.S. Under the terms of this facility, the Company has acquired an irrevocable put option to issue preference ordinary shares into a trust in return for proceedsraised from investors. This put option may be exercised by the Company at any time. In addition, the Company may be required to issue preference ordinary shares to the trust under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, the non-paymentof the put option premium and a ratings downgrade of the Company. In connection with this transaction, the fair value of the put premiums and other related costs, in total of $111.9 million was transferred from “Additional paid incapital” to a deferred liability which was established (included with “Other liabilities”) in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2003.

     It is anticipated that the commercial facilities will be renewed on expiry but such renewals are subject to the availability of credit from banks utilized by the Company, or other financialinstitutions. In the event that such credit support is insufficient, the Company could be required to provide alternative security to cedents. This could take the form of insurance trusts supported by the Company's investment portfolio or fundswithheld (amounts retained by ceding companies to collateralize loss or premium reserves) using the Company's cash resources or combinations thereof. The face amount of letters of credit required is driven by, among other things, lossdevelopment of existing reserves, the payment pattern of such reserves, the expansion of business written by the Company and the loss experience of such business. In addition to letters of credit, the Company has established insurance trusts in theU.S. that provide cedents with statutory relief required under state insurance regulation in the U.S.

     The Company reviews current and projected collateral requirements on a regular basis, as well as new sources of collateral. Management's objective is to maintain an excess amount ofcollateral sources over expected uses. The Company also reviews its liquidity needs on a regular basis.

     The following letter of credit facilities were originated or renewed during 2005:

In December 2005, the Company created a new $100 million unsecured bilateral credit facility that was
 unutilized during 2005 and at December 31, 2005. The full amount of $100 millionis available as both
 revolving credit and letters of credit, with the combined total not to exceed $100 million.

In September 2005, the Company renewed an unsecured bilateral credit facility of $150 million (previously
 $200 million) that was fully utilized at December 31, 2005.

In August 2005, the Company created a new unsecured bilateral credit facility of $100 million that was
 unutilized at December 31, 2005.

In June 2005, the Company replaced its $1.0 billion 364-day credit and letter of credit facility with a $2.35
 billion facility with a tenor of 5 years. Of the aggregate amount of$2.35 billion, $1.0 billion is available as
 revolving credit and up to $2.25 billion is available in the form of letters of credit, with the combined total
 not to exceed$2.35 billion. As at December 31, 2005, approximately $2.1 billion of the 5-year facility was
 in use in the form of letters of credit.


     In addition to the letter of credit facilities described above, the Company has the following facility:

$500 million commercial paper-based facility. In February 2003, the Company entered into an aggregate of
 $300.0 million of commercial paper-based credit facilities (the “CreditFacilities”). These facilities were
 increased to $500.0 million in June 2003. The proceeds of advances under the Credit Facilities were used
 to fund a trust account tocollateralize the reinsurance obligations of the Company under an inter-company
 quota share reinsurance agreement. The Company could face additional obligations under the Credit
 Facilities prior to the stated maturity of February 25, 2008, if certain events were to occur, including, but
 not limited to the Company's insolvency, withdrawal of assets from the Regulation 114trust by the ceding
 company, the downgrade of the Company's credit ratings below certain specified levels, or the failure of
 the agent to have a first priority perfected securityinterest in the collateral posted by the Company. At
 maturity, the Company will be obligated to make payments in an amount equal to the principal and accrued
 interest outstandingunder the Credit Facilities. The issued securities and the Company's repayment obligations are recorded as a net balance on the Company's balance sheet.


Cross-Default and Other Provisions in Debt Documents


     The following describes certain terms of the documents referred to below. All documents referred to below have been filed with the SEC and should be referred to for an assessment of thecomplete contractual obligations of the Company.

     In general, all of the Company's bank facilities, indentures and other documents relating to the Company's outstanding indebtedness, including the Credit Facilities discussed above(collectively, the “Company's Debt

96


Documents”), contain cross default provisions to each other and the Company's Debt Documents contain affirmative covenants. These covenants provide for, among other things, minimum required ratings of theCompany's insurance and reinsurance operating subsidiaries (other than its AAA financial guaranty companies) and the level of secured indebtedness in the future. In addition, generally each of the Company's Debt Documents provide for anevent of default in the event of a change of control of the Company or some events involving bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company. The Company's credit facilities and the 6.58% Guaranteed Senior Notes also contain minimumconsolidated net worth covenants.

     Under the Company's 364-day facilities, 3-year credit facility, five-year credit facilities placement notes described above, in the event that the Company XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd and XLRe Ltd fail to maintain a financial strength rating of at least “A-” from A.M. Best, an event of default would occur. The Company currently has an “A+ (stable)” rating from A.M. Best.

     Under the Company's ten-year private placement notes described above, in the event that the Company fails to maintain a financial strength rating of at least “A” from A.M. Bestor XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd and XL Re Ltd fail to maintain a financial strength rating of at least “A” from S&P, an event of default would occur. The Company and its subsidiaries currently has an “A+” (stable) rating fromA.M. Best and “A+” (stable) S&P.

     The 6.5% Guaranteed Senior Notes indentures contains a cross default provision. In general, in the event that the Company defaults in the payment of indebtedness in the amount of $50.0million or more, an event of default would be triggered under the Guaranteed Senior Notes indentures. Given that all of the Company's Debt Documents contain cross default provisions, this may result in all holders declaring such debt due andpayable and an acceleration of all debt due under those documents. If this were to occur, the Company may not have funds sufficient at that time to repay any or all of such indebtedness.

     In addition, the Company's unsecured Lloyd's letter of credit facility provides that, in the event that the Company's insurance and reinsurance rated operating subsidiaries inBermuda fall below a rating of “A-”, the facility would then be required to be fully secured by the Company, at which time the Company would be required to either (i) provide an amount in cash to cover an amount equal to the aggregateletters of credit outstanding at that time or (ii) deposit assets in trust securing 105% of the aggregate letters of credit outstanding at that time. If this were to occur, the Company may not be able to provide the collateral required in order tomaintain this facility.

Long-Term Contractual Obligations

        (1)     

        Deposit liabilities on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2005 amounted to $8,240,987.The difference from the amount included above relates to the discount on payments due in the future.The payment related to these liabilities varies primarily based on interest rates. The ultimate paymentsassociated with these liabilities could differ from the Company's estimate. See Item 8, Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

       (2)     

     The unpaid loss and loss expenses amounted        to $23,767,672 on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet at        December 31, 2005. The timing and amounts of actual claims payments related        to these reserves vary based on many factors including large individual        losses, changes in the legal environment, as well as general market conditions.        The ultimate amount of the claims payments could differ materially from        the Company's estimated amounts. For information regarding the estimates        for unpaid loss and loss expenses as well as factors effecting potential        payment patterns of reserves for actual and potential claims related        the Company's different lines of business see “Critical Accounting        Policies and Estimates” above. Certain lines of business written        by the Company, such as excess casualty, have loss experience characterized        as low frequency and high severity. This may result in significant variability        in loss payment patterns and, therefore, may impact the related asset/liability        investment management process. In order to be in a position, if necessary,        to make these payments, the Company's liquidity requirements are        supported by having revolving lines of credit facilities available to        the Company and significant reinsurance programs, in addition to the        Company's general high grade fixed income investment portfolio.

  
       (3)

     Future policy benefit reserves on life and        annuity business amounted to $5,606,461 on the Company's Consolidated        Balance Sheet at December 31, 2005. Amounts included above include an        allowance for future premiums in respect of contracts under which premiums        are payable throughout the life of the underlying policy. The value of        the discount is also included for those lines of business that have reserves        where future claim payments and future premium receipts can be estimated        using actuarial principles. The timing and amounts of actual claims payments        and premium receipts related to these reserves vary based on the underlying        experience of the portfolio. Typical elements of the experience include        mortality, morbidity and persistency. The ultimate amount of the claims        payments and premium receipts could differ materially from the Company's        estimated amounts.

  
       (4)

     Contingent capital facilities related payments        include an estimate at the payments due under the past option agreement        of $200 per month. Actual payments depend on the return on certain        assets and LIBOR.

  

Variable Interest Entities and Other Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements


     The Company utilizes variable interest entities both indirectly and directly in the ordinary course of the Company's business.

     The Company provides various forms of credit enhancement including financial guaranty insurance and reinsurance of structured transactions backed by pools of assets of specified types,municipal obligations supported by the issuers' ability to charge fees for specified services or projects, and structured single risk-based obligations including essential infrastructure projects and obligations backed by receivables fromfuture sales of commodities and other specified services. The obligations related to these transactions are often securitized through variable interest entities.In synthetic transactions, the Company guarantees payment obligations of counterpartiesincluding special purpose vehicles under credit derivatives referencing assetportfolios. The Company invests in collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”), and other investment vehicles that are issued through variable interest entities aspart of the Company's risk asset portfolio.

     In 2003, the Company entered into an aggregate of $500.0 million of commercial paper-based credit facilities (the “Credit Facilities”). The proceeds of advances under the CreditFacilities were used to fund a trust account (“Trust”) to collateralize the reinsurance obligations of the Company under an intercompany quota share reinsurance agreement. The issued securities and the Company's repayment obligationswill be recorded as a net balance on the Company's balance sheet because the Company has a contractual legal right of offset. In the event that in the future the Company were to not have the right to offset such assets (as, for example, wouldbe the case if the assets in the Trust were withdrawn in order to satisfy the Company's reinsurance obligations or if lender-issued securities could not be held in the Trust because they did not qualify as permitted assets under the trustagreement), then all or a portion of the assets in the Trust and the Company's repayment obligations under the Credit Facilities would be required to be included as assets and liabilities on a gross basis, respectively, on the Company'sbalance sheet. See also “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for more details regarding this off-balance sheet collateral arrangement.

     In December 2004, XLFA entered into a put option agreement and an asset trust expense reimbursement agreement with the Asset Trust. The put option agreement provides XLFA with the irrevocableright to require the Asset Trust at any time and from time to time to purchase XLFA's non-cumulative perpetual Series B Preferred Shares with an aggregate liquidation preference of up to $200 million. XLFA is obligated to reimburse theAsset Trust for certain fees and ordinary expenses. To the extent that any Series B Preferred Shares are put to the Asset Trust and remain outstanding, a corresponding portion of such fees and ordinary expenses will be payable by XLFA pursuant tothe asset trust expense reimbursement agreement. The put option agreement is perpetual but would terminate on delivery of notice by XLFA on or after December 9, 2009, or under certain defined circumstances, such as the failure of XLFA to

pay the put option premium when due or bankruptcy. The put option is recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings.

     In July 2003, the Company entered into a contingent capital transaction with an aggregate value of $500.0 million. This transaction also provides the Company with an insurance trust thatprovides the Company with statutory relief under state insurance regulations in the U.S. Under the terms of this facility, the Company has acquired an irrevocable put option to issue preference ordinary shares into a trust in return for proceedsraised from investors. This put option may be exercised by the Company at any time. In addition, the Company may be required to issue preference ordinary shares to the trust under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, the non-paymentof the put option premium and a ratings downgrade of the Company.

     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK


     The following risk management discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the sensitivity and value-at-risk (“VaR”) analyses presented in this document are forward-lookingstatements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimated results due to, among other things, actual developments in the global financial markets. The resultsof analysis used by the Company to assess and mitigate risk should not be considered projections of future events of losses. See “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Cautionary NoteRegarding Forward-Looking Statements.”

     The Company enters into derivatives and other financial instruments primarily for risk management purposes. The Company's derivative transactions can expose the Company to creditderivative risk, weather and energy risk, investment market risk, and foreign currency exchange rate risk. The Company attempts to manage these risks based on guidelines established by senior management. Derivative instruments are carried at fairvalue with the resulting changes in fair value recognized in income in the period in which they occur.

Credit Derivative Risk

     The Company enters into swaps written under International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) forms as an extension of its financial guaranty business. The fair value isdetermined using models developed by the Company and is dependent upon a number of factors, including changes in interest rates, future default rates, changes in credit quality, future expected recovery rates and other market factors. Other elementsof the change in fair value are based upon pricing established at the inception of the contract. A change in the interest, default and recovery rate assumptions indicated below would cause the fair value associated with credit derivatives todecrease as follows:

     Fair values for the Company's natural gas derivative contracts are determined through the use of quoted market prices. As quoted market prices are not widely available in the weatherderivative market, management uses available market data and internal pricing models based upon consistent statistical methodologies to estimate fair values. Estimating fair value of instruments that do not have quoted market prices, requiresmanagement's judgment in determining amounts that could reasonably be expected to be received from, or paid to, a third party in respect of the contracts. The amounts could be materially different from the amounts that might be realized in anactual sale transaction. Fair values are subject to change in the near-term and reflect management's best estimate based on various factors including, but not limited to, realized and forecasted weather conditions, changes in interest rates andother market factors.

     The following table summarizes the movement in the fair value of contracts outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2005:

        (1)     

        For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company collected $26.4 million of paid premiums and realized $29.5 million of premiums on expired transactions for a net decrease in the balance sheet derivative liabilityof $3.1 million.


        (2)

        The Company received $3.6 million to settle derivative positions during the year ended December 31, 2005, resulting in a reclassification of this amount from unrealized to realized and an increase in the balance sheetderivative liability.


        (3)

        This represents the effects of changes in commodity prices, the time value of options, and other valuation adjustments of $18.2 million on the Company's derivative positions, primarily attributable to the hedges ofthe positions that realized $29.5 million of premiums.



     The change in fair value of contracts outstanding at December 31, 2005, as compared to the beginning of the year is primarily due to the settlement of positive fair value positions during thefirst half of the year.

Investment Market Risk

     The Company's investment portfolio is managed by external investment professionals under the direction of the Company's management and generally in accordance with detailed investmentguidelines provided and monitored by the Company. Managers are selected directly by the Company on the basis of various criteria, including investment style, track record, performance, internal controls, operational risk, and diversificationimplications. The vast majority of the Company's investment portfolio is managed by well established, large institutional investment professionals.

     The Company's investment portfolio consists of exposures to fixed income securities, equities, alternative investments, derivatives, business and other investments and cash. Thesesecurities and investments are denominated in both U.S. dollar and foreign currencies.

101


     Through the structure of the Company's investment portfolio, the Company's earnings and book value are directly affected by changes in the valuations of the securities and investmentsheld in the investment portfolio. These valuation changes reflect changes in interest rates (
e.g., 

changes in the level, slope and curvature of yield curves, volatility ofinterest rates, mortgage prepayment speeds and credit spreads), credit quality, equity prices (
e.g., 

changes in prices and volatilities of individual securities, equity basketsand equity indices) and foreign currency exchange rates (
e.g., 

changes in spot prices, forward prices and volatilities of currency rates). Market risk therefore arises due tothe uncertainty surrounding the future valuations of these different assets, the factors that impact their values and the impact that this could have on the Company's earnings.

     The Company seeks to manage the risks of the investment portfolio through a combination of asset class, country, industry and security level diversification and investment manager allocations.These allocation decisions are made relative to the liability profile of the Company and the Company's surplus. Further, individual security and issuer exposures are controlled and monitored at the investment portfolio level, via specificinvestment constraints outlined in investment guidelines and agreed with the external investment professionals. Additional constraints are generally agreed with the external investment professionals, which may address exposures to eligiblesecurities, prohibited investments/transactions, credit quality and general concentrations limits.

     The Company's direct use of investment derivatives includes futures, forwards, swaps and option contracts that derive their value from underlying assets, indices, reference rates or acombination of these factors. When investment guidelines allow for the use of derivatives, these can generally only be used for the purpose of managing interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, credit risk and replicating permitted investments,provided the use of such instruments is incorporated in the overall portfolio duration, spread, convexity and other relevant portfolio metrics. The direct use of derivatives is generally not permitted to economically leverage the portfolio outsideof the stated guidelines. Derivatives may also be used to add value to the investment portfolio where market inefficiencies are perceived to exist, to utilize cash holdings to purchase equity indexed derivatives and to adjust the duration of aportfolio of fixed income securities to match the duration of related deposit liabilities.

Investment Value-at-Risk

     Central to the Company's market risk management framework is VaR. VaR is a statistical risk measure, calculating the level of potential losses that could be expected to be exceeded, over aspecified holding period and at a given level of confidence, in normal market conditions, due to adverse movements in the investment portfolio's underlying securities and investments valuations.

     The Company calculates the VaR of the investment portfolio using a one month time horizon and a 95% level of confidence. This means that, on average, the Company could expect losses greaterthan predicted by the VaR results 5% of the time, or once every 20 months. The calculation of VaR is performed monthly using a full valuation based on the Monte Carlo approach and it is expressed both in terms of U.S. dollars and as a percentage ofthe Company's investment portfolio.

     The modeling of the risk of any portfolio, as measured by VaR, involves a number of assumptions and approximations. While the Company believes that its assumptions and approximations areappropriate, there is no uniform industry methodology for calculating VaR. The Company notes that different VaR results can be produced for the same portfolio dependent, not only on the approach used but also on the assumptions employed whenimplementing the approach.

     The VaR approach uses historical data to determine the sensitivity of each of the underlying securities to the risk factors incorporated into the models that are employed in the Monte Carlosimulations. In calculating these sensitivities, greater importance is placed on the more recent data points and information. Since the VaR approach is based on historical positions and market data, VaR results should not be viewed as an absoluteand predictive gauge of future financial performance or as a way for the Company to predict risk. There is no assurance that the Company's actual future losses will not exceed its VaR and the Company expects that 5% of the time the VaR will beexceeded.

Additionally, the Company acknowledges the fact that risks associated with abnormal market events can be significantly different from the VaR results and these are by definition not reflected or assessed in the VaRanalysis.

     The VaR of the investment portfolio at December 31, 2005 was approximately $489.0 million. The VaR of all investment relative derivatives excluding investments in affiliates and otherinvestments was $26.3 million at December 31, 2005.

     In instances where the data or time series are insufficient to determine the risk factor sensitivities, the VaR approach uses proxy time series data available for similar instruments. As atDecember 31, 2005, approximately $16.5 billion (41% of the Company's investment portfolio at market value) used proxy time series data.

     Approximately $12.4 billion related to various fixed income portfolios, $2.5 billion to various cash portfolios, $1.3 billion to alternative investments, $252.2 million toprivate investments, $105.2 million to equity portfolios, and $4.5 million to derivatives. The Company reviews the proxies to ensure that an appropriate data and time series is being used in the calculations and that the proxies used areconservative.

     The following two tables show the Company's average, minimum and maximum VaR in percentage and dollar terms for the total investment portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2005,based upon the VaR at quarter end dates. The two tables also include the Company's VaR in percentage and dollar terms, respectively, for the total investment portfolio as at December 31, 2005. The Company's investment portfolio VaR as atDecember 31, 2005 is not necessarily indicative of future VaR levels.

        The majority of the Company's alternative investment portfolio is accounted for as investments in affiliates. However, for purposes of monitoring and tracking the Company's total investment market risk, thetotal alternative investment portfolio is included in these calculations.

        Average Total Undiversified VaR for the year ended December 31, 2005 and Total Undiversified VaR at December 31, 2005 is the summation of the individual VaRs for each of the separate asset classes and, by construction,ignores any and all correlations between the different asset classes. The Total Undiversified VaR therefore ignores diversification benefits that exist in between these different asset classes. Maximum and Minimum Total Undiversified VaR is notnecessarily the summation of the individual VaRs for each of the separate asset classes since the Maximum and Minimum VaRs for each of the asset classes and the Maximum and Minimum Total Undiversified VaR do not necessarily refer to the same pointin time.


        (4)

        Diversification VaR equals the difference between the Total Investment Portfolio VaR and the Total Undiversified VaR. As the former explicitly accounts for the correlations and diversification benefits that exist betweenthe actual asset classes and the latter explicitly does not, the difference in the two VaR results is due to the “diversification benefits.” These diversification benefits arise due to the risk reduction that

 occurs when different assets, that are not perfectly correlated, are combined in a portfolio. It will vary over time dependent on: allocations changes; changes in the correlations between the different asset classes; andchanges in the general asset class risks. The NA reflects the fact that, since the Minimum and Maximum VaR for the six different asset class portfolios do not refer to the same point in time, therefore it is not meaningful to calculate theDiversification VaR.


        (5)     

        Total Investment Portfolio VaR is the Company's investment portfolio VaR based on the prescribed methodology that explicitly accounts for the diversification benefits that occur when each of the allocations to theindividual asset classes are included in the investment portfolio.


        (6)

        Based on a 95% confidence level with a one month holding period, expressed in millions of U.S. Dollars.



     The Company's total investment portfolio VaR is driven by: the size of the overall investment portfolio; the size of the allocations to the different asset classes and securities in theasset classes; the risks associated with each of the asset classes and securities; and the correlations and diversification benefits between each of the asset classes and securities. Changes in any of these variables will have a direct impact on theCompany's VaR.

     The Company's total undiversified VaR, which ignores any correlation and diversification benefits, at December 31, 2005 was 1.51% compared to a maximum of 1.77% and a minimum of 1.44%during 2005. The Company's average diversification VaR during 2005 resulted in an average reduction of the Company's total undiversified VaR of 0.24% and as at December 31, 2005 was 0.30% .

     The Company's total investment portfolio VaR was on average 1.37% during 2005 and as at December 31, 2005, was 1.21% . The Company's maximum and minimum total investment portfolio VaRduring 2005 were 1.55% and 1.20%, respectively. The Company's largest VaR exposure during the year ended December 31, 2005 was to fixed income. The average VaR for fixed income was 1.35%, compared to a maximum of 1.55% and a minimum of 1.16% .As at December 31, 2005, the fixed income VaR was 1.27% .

     At December 31, 2005, the ranking for the Company's asset class risk, based on the individual asset class VaRs, was: fixed income; alternative investments; derivatives; equity; privateinvestments; and cash equivalents.

Stress Testing

     VaR does not provide the means to estimate the magnitude of the loss in the 5% of occurrences that the Company expects the VaR level to be exceeded. To complement the VaR analysis based onnormal market environments, the Company considers the impact on the investment portfolio in several different historical stress periods to analyze the effect of unusual market conditions. The Company establishes certain historical stress testscenarios which are applied to the actual investment portfolio. As these stress tests and estimated gains and losses are based on historical events, they will not necessarily reflect future stress events or gains and losses from such events. Theresults of the stress test scenarios are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure they are appropriate, based on current shareholders equity, market conditions and the Company's total risk tolerance.

     The table below shows the maximum impact on the Company's investment portfolio if all events stress tested were to repeat themselves, given the actual investment portfolio'sallocations at the quarters ended March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, 2005. The Company assumes that no action is taken during the stress period to either liquidate or rebalance the portfolio. The Company believes that this fairlyreflects the potential decreased liquidity that is often associated with stressed market environments.

Fixed Income Portfolio

     The Company's fixed income portfolio is exposed to credit and interest rate risk through its portfolio of debt securities, and includes fixed maturities and short-term investments. Thefixed income portfolio includes fixed maturities, short-term investments, cash and cash equivalents and net payable for investments purchased.

     As at December 31, 2005, the value of the Company's fixed income portfolio including cash and cash equivalents and net payable for investments purchased was approximately $37.9 billionas compared to approximately $28.9 billion as at December 31, 2004. As at December 31, 2005, the fixed income portfolio consisted of approximately 91.1% of the total investment portfolio (including cash and cash equivalents, accrued investmentincome and net payable for investments purchased) as compared to approximately 89.1% as at December 31, 2004.

     The Company manages credit risk in the investment portfolio through the credit research performed by the external investment professionals and limitations on the investment portfolio'sexposure to individual credits, as set by the Company. Limits are set for each credit quality rating and are a function of the probability of default and the expected loss in the event of a default. Limits ensure that potential losses fromindividual defaults should not exceed predetermined levels.

     The Company reviews on a regular basis its corporate debt concentration, credit quality and compliance with established credit limits. Any obligor over its credit limits, experiencing financialdifficulties, material credit quality deterioration or potentially subject to forthcoming credit quality deterioration is placed on a Watch List for closer monitoring. Where appropriate, exposures are reduced or prevented from increasing.

     The table below shows the Company's fixed income portfolio by credit rating in percentage terms of the Company's total fixed income exposure (including fixed maturities, short-terminvestments, cash and cash equivalents and net payable for investments purchased) as at December 31, 2005.

(1)      Including fixed maturities,short-term investments, cash and cash equivalents and net payable for investmentspurchased.
     The Company's fixed income portfolio is exposed to interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is the price sensitivity of a fixed income security to changes in interest rates. The Companymanages interest rate risk within the context of its overall asset liability management strategy by setting duration targets for its investment portfolio in line with the estimated duration of its liabilities, thus mitigating the overall economiceffect of interest rate risk. The Company remains nevertheless exposed to accounting interest rate risk since the assets are marked to market, thus subject to market conditions, while liabilities are accrued at a static rate. The hypothetical caseof an immediate 100 basis point adverse parallel shift in global bond curves as at December 31, 2005, would decrease the fair value of the Company's fixed income portfolio by approximately 3.9% or $1.5 billion. Based on historicalobservations, it is unlikely that all global yield curves would shift uniformly in the same direction and at the same time.

     In addition, the Company has short-term debt and long-term debt outstanding. Interest rates on short-term debt are LIBOR-based. Accordingly, any changes in interest rates will affect interestexpense.

     Equity Portfolio


     As at December 31, 2005, the Company's equity portfolio, which for financial reporting purposes includes certain fixed income mutual fund investments that do not have the riskcharacteristics of equity investments, was $869 million as compared to $963 million as at December 31, 2004. As at December 31, 2005, the Company's allocation to equity securities was approximately 2.1% of the total investment portfolio(including cash and cash equivalents, accrued investment income and net payable for investments purchased) as compared to approximately 3.0% as at December 31, 2004.

     As at December 31, 2005, approximately 53% of the equity portfolio was invested in U.S. companies as compared to approximately 60% as at December 31, 2004. As at December 31, 2005, the top tenequity holdings represented approximately 5.8% of the Company's total equity portfolio as compared to approximately 8.0% as at December 31, 2004.

     The Company's equity portfolio is exposed to price risk. Equity price risk is the potential loss arising from decreases in the market value of equities. An immediate hypothetical 10%change in the value of each equity position would affect the fair value of the portfolio by approximately $86.9 million as at December 31, 2005.

     Alternative Investment Portfolio


     A portion of the Company's portfolio is invested in funds that pursue alternative investment strategies, with the investment objective of attaining high risk-adjusted total return whilemaintaining moderate to low level of sensitivity to movements in the traditional asset classes and realizing a low volatility. Investments within this portfolio are generally fund investments in limited partnerships or similar vehicles, with eachfund pursuing absolute return investment

106


mandates, typically investing in one or more of the traditional asset classes including equities, fixed income, credit, currency and commodity markets.

     Various strategies can be pursued and the Company classifies each fund allocation into four general style categories. The four styles are: Event driven, which includes strategies that pursuemerger arbitrage, distressed and special situations opportunities; Directional/tactical, which includes strategies that pursue long/short equity, managed futures and macro opportunities; Arbitrage, which includes strategies that pursue equity marketneutral, fixed income arbi-trage and convertible arbitrage opportunities; and Multi-strategy, which includes strategies incorporating aspects of the above.

     The Company utilizes additional risk and portfolio management analytics and processes to enhance the overall management and assessment of the alternative investment portfolio. Central to theportfolio and risk management processes is the receipt of information on each of its allocations that is sufficient to assess risks and exposures of the fund allocations and to monitor how the portfolio and associated risk changes over time. Thelevel and frequency of information required by the Company on each investment depends on the type of strategy that a fund pursues; the expected risk profile and types of risk that the fund and underlying securities are exposed to the liquidity ofthe fund and underlying securities; and the size of the allocation.

     The Company's alternative investment portfolio had approximately 80 separate investments in different funds at December 31, 2005 with a total exposure of $1.7 billion making upapproximately 4.1% of total investments compared to December 31, 2004 where the Company had over 100 separate fund investments with a total exposure of $1.7 billion representing approximately 5.2% of total investments.

     At December 31, 2005, the alternative investment style allocation was 43% in Directional/tactical strategies, 31% in Event driven strategies, 18% in Arbitrage strategies, and 8% inMulti-strategy strategies. At December 31, 2004, the Alternative investment style allocation was 42% in Directional/tactical strategies, 25% in Arbitrage strategies, 25% in Event driven strategies and 8% in Multi-strategy strategies.

     Private Investment Portfolio

     A portion of the Company's portfolio is invested in limited partnerships and other entities which are not publicly traded. In addition to normal market risks, these positions may also beexposed to liquidity risk, risks related to distressed investments, and risks specific to startup or small companies.

     As at December 31, 2005, the Company's exposure to private investments was approximately $252.2 million compared to $187.1 million as at December 31, 2004. As at December 31, 2005,and 2004, the Company's exposure to private investments consisted of approximately 0.6% of the total investment portfolio (including cash and cash equivalents, accrued investment income and net payable for investments purchased).

     Bond and Stock Index Futures Exposure

     At December 31, 2005, bond and stock index futures outstanding had a net long position of $46.4 million as compared to a net long position of $1.3 billion at December 31, 2004. A 10%appreciation or depreciation of the underlying exposure to these derivative instruments would have resulted in realized gains or realized losses of $4.6 million as at December 31, 2005 and $129.5 million as at December 31, 2004,respectively. The Company may reduce its exposure to these futures through offsetting transactions, including options and forwards.

     Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

     The Company has exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through its operations and in its investment portfolio. The Company's net foreign currency denominated payable onforeign exchange contracts was $603 million and $3.8 million as at December 31, 2005 and 2004 respectively, with a net unrealized gain of $15.9 million and a net unrealized loss of $11.8 million as at December 31, 2004 and 2005,respectively.

107


     Foreign exchange contracts within the investment portfolio are utilized to manage individual portfolio foreign exchange exposures, subject to investment manager guidelines established bymanagement. These contracts are not designated as specific hedges for financial reporting purposes and, therefore, realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in income in the period in which they occur. These contractsgenerally have maturities of three months or less.

     The Company also attempts to manage the foreign exchange volatility arising on certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies. These include, but are not limited to, premium receivable,reinsurance contracts, claims payable and investments in subsidiaries.

     Credit Risk

     The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by the other parties to its forward contracts, however the Company does not anticipate non-performance. The differencebetween the notional principal amounts and the associated market value is the Company's maximum credit exposure.

  XL CAPITAL LTD

    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

  FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003


1. History


     XL Capital Ltd together with its subsidiaries (the “Company” or “XL”), is a holding company organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands. XL Capital Ltd was incorporatedon March 16, 1998, as the successor to EXEL Limited, a Cayman Islands corporation organized in 1986, in connection with EXEL Limited's merger with Mid Ocean Limited, a Cayman Islands corporation. XL Capital Ltd operated under the name EXELLimited from completion of the merger until February 1, 1999, when its current name was approved by the requisite vote of the Company's shareholders. The Company provides insurance and reinsurance coverages and financial products and servicesto industrial, commercial and professional service firms, insurance companies and other enterprises on a worldwide basis.

     Effective January 1, 2002, the Company increased its shareholding in Le Mans RÉ from 49% to 67% in order to expand its international reinsurance operations. Due to certain contractualarrangements between the Company and Les Mutuelles du Mans Assurances Group (“MMA”), MMA did not have any economic interest in the earnings of Le Mans RÉ with effect from January 1, 2002 and accordingly, no minority interest wasrecorded from that date. In September 2003, the Company purchased the remaining 33% and Le Mans RÉ was renamed “XL Re Europe”. XL Re Europe underwrites a worldwide portfolio comprising most classes of property and casualtyreinsurance business, together with a selective portfolio of life reinsurance business. See Note 5 for additional information.

     On July 25, 2001, the Company acquired certain Winterthur International insurance operations (the “Winterthur Business”) to extend its predominantly North American-based largecorporate business globally. Effective July 1, 2001, the Company's results include the Winterthur Business. See Note 5 for additional information. In 2003, the Company re-branded “XL Winterthur International” to “XL InsuranceGlobal Risk”.

     In 1999, XL Capital Ltd merged with NAC Re Corp (“NAC”), a Delaware corporation. NAC was organized in 1985 and wrote property and casualty insurance and reinsurance in the U.S.,Canada and Europe.

2. Significant Accounting Policies


     (a) Basis of Preparation and Consolidation


     These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all of its subsidiaries. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accountingprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Certain amounts in 2004 and 2003 have been reclassified to conform to the current yearpresentation.

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure ofcontingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While management believes that the amounts included in the consolidated financial statementsreflect the Company's best estimates and assumptions, actual results could differ from these estimates.

     (b) Premiums and Acquisition Costs


     Insurance premiums written are recorded in accordance with the terms of the underlying policies. Reinsurance premiums written are recorded at the inception of the policy and are estimated basedupon information received from ceding companies and any subsequent differences arising on such estimates are recorded in the period they are determined. Financial guaranty installment premiums are recorded as premiums written when due.

2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Unearned premiums represent the portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of policies in force. Net premiums earned are presented after deductions for reinsurance ceded, as applicable.

     Reinstatement premiums are recognized and earned at the time a loss event occurs.

     Life and annuity premiums from long duration contracts that transfer significant mortality or morbidity risks are recognized as revenue and earned when due from policyholders. Life and annuitypremiums from long duration contracts that do not subject the Company to risks arising from policyholder mortality or morbidity are accounted for as investment contracts and presented within deposit liabilities.

     Acquisition costs, which vary with and are directly related to the acquisition of policies, consist primarily of commissions paid to brokers and cedents and certain underwriting costs and aredeferred and amortized over the period that the premiums are earned. Acquisition costs are shown net of commissions earned on reinsurance ceded. Future earned premiums, the anticipated losses and other costs (and in the case of a premium deficiency,investment income) related to those premiums, are also considered in determining the level of acquisition costs to be deferred.

     (c) Reinsurance


     In the normal course of business, the Company seeks to reduce the potential amount of loss arising from claims events by reinsuring certain levels of risk assumed in various areas of exposurewith other insurers or reinsurers. Reinsurance premiums ceded are expensed (and any commissions recorded thereon are earned) on a monthly pro-rata basis over the period the reinsurance coverage is provided. Prepaid reinsurance premiums represent theportion of premiums ceded applicable to the unexpired term of policies in force. Reinstatement premiums ceded are recorded at the time a loss event occurs. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claimliability associated with the reinsured policy. Provisions are made for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance.

     (d) Fee Income and Other


     Fee income and other includes fees received for insurance and product structuring services provided and is earned over the service period of the contract. Any adjustments to fees earned or theservice period are reflected in income in the period when determined.

     (e) Other Than Temporary Declines in Investments


     The Company reviews the fair value of its investment portfolio on a periodic basis to identify declines in fair value below the carrying value that are other than temporary. This reviewinvolves consideration of several factors including (i) the time period during which there has been a significant decline in fair value below carrying value, (ii) an analysis of the liquidity, business prospects and overall financial condition ofthe issuer, (iii) the significance of the decline, (iv) an analysis of the collateral structure and other credit support, as applicable, of the securities in question and (v) the Company's intent and ability to hold the investment for asufficient period of time for the value to recover. Where the Company concludes that declines in fair values are other than temporary, the cost of the security is written down to fair value below carrying value and the previously unrealized loss istherefore realized in the period such determination is made.

     (e) Other Than Temporary Declines in Investments (continued)


     With respect to securities where the decline in value is determined to be temporary and the security's value is not written down, a subsequent decision may be made to sell that securityand realize a loss. Subsequent decisions on security sales are made within the context of overall risk monitoring, changing information, market conditions generally and assessing value relative to other comparable securities.

     (f) Derivative Instruments and Weather Derivative Contracts


     The Company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measures those instruments at fair value. Non-exchange traded weather products are recorded atfair value. The changes in fair value of derivatives are shown in the consolidated statement of income as “net realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments” unless the derivatives are designated as hedginginstruments. If the derivatives qualify as hedges, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are either offset against the change in fair value of assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings, orrecognized in accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Any ineffective portion of a derivative's change in fair value is recognized immediately in earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives maycreate volatility in the Company's results of operations from period to period.

     The Company conducts activities in three main types of instruments: credit derivatives, weather and energy derivatives and investment related derivatives.

     Credit derivatives



     Credit derivatives are recorded at fair value, which is determined using models developed by the Company and is dependent upon a number of factors, including changes in interest rates, futuredefault rates, credit spreads, changes in credit quality, future expected recovery rates and other market factors. The change resulting from movements in credit and credit quality spreads is unrealized as the credit derivatives are not traded torealize this resultant value.

     For all periods reported herein, the Company amended the presentation of certain credit derivative transactions (described below) in the consolidated statements of income to include certaincomponents of the change in fair value in “gross premiums written”, “net premiums earned” and “net losses and loss expenses incurred”, and in the consolidated balance sheet, certain components of the fair value in“unearned premiums” and “unpaid loss and loss expenses.” Previously, the change in fair value of all of the Company's derivative transactions was reflected in one line item under “net realized and unrealized gains andlosses on derivative instruments”, and the fair value had been reflected in “other assets” and “other liabilities.” There was no effect on net income as a result of this change in presentation and prior period results havebeen reclassified to reflect this presentation. This change in presentation is applicable only to credit default swaps issued by the Company that are investment grade and that the Company intends, and has the ability, to hold to maturity, and isconsistent with practices in the financial guaranty insurance industry for reporting the results of such instruments.

     Weather and Energy derivatives



     Fair values for the Company's natural gas contracts are determined through the use of quoted market prices. As quoted market prices are not widely available in the weather and electricityderivative markets, management uses available market data and internal pricing models based upon consistent statistical methodologies to estimate fair values. Estimating the fair value of instruments which do not have quoted market prices requiresmanagement's judgment in determining amounts which could reasonably be expected to be received from, or paid to, a third party in settlement of the contracts. The amounts could be materially different from the amounts that might be realized inan actual sale transaction. Fair values are subject to change in the near-term and reflect management's best estimate based on various factors including, but not limited to, actual and forecasted weather conditions, changes in commodity prices,changes in interest rates and other market factors.

     (f) Derivative Instruments and Weather Derivative Contracts (continued)


     Investment Related derivatives



     The Company uses derivative instruments to manage duration and foreign currency exposure for its investment portfolio.

     The Company uses investment derivative instruments, primarily interest rate swaps, to manage the interest rate exposure associated with certain assets and liabilities. All interest rate swapsare recorded at fair value. Changes in the value of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges are recorded as adjustments to the hedged items to the extent that the hedge is effective. Changes in the value of derivative instrumentsdesignated as cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective. The ineffective portion of both fair value and cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings.

     The Company also has investment related derivatives embedded in certain reinsurance contracts. For a particular life reinsurance contract, the Company pays the ceding company a fixed amountequal to the estimated present value of the excess of guaranteed benefit (“GMIB”) over the account balance upon the policyholder's election to take the income benefit. The fair value of this derivative is determined based on thepresent value of expected cash flows. In addition, the Company has modified coinsurance and funds withheld reinsurance agreements that provide for a return based on a portfolio of fixed income securities; as such, the agreements contain embeddedderivatives. The embedded derivative is bifurcated and recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings.

     (g) Total Investments


     Investments Available For Sale



     Investments that are considered available for sale are carried at fair value. The fair value of investments is based upon quoted market values where available or by reference to broker orunderwriter bid indications. The net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments, net of tax, is included in “accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)”. Any unrealized depreciation in value considered by management to beother than temporary is charged to income in the period that it is determined.

     Short-term investments comprise investments with a remaining maturity less than one year. Equity securities include investments in open end mutual funds.

     All investment transactions are recorded on a trade date basis. Realized gains and losses on sales of equities and fixed income investments are determined on the basis of average cost andamortized cost, respectively. Investment income is recognized when earned and includes interest and dividend income together with the amortization of premium and discount on fixed maturities and short-term investments.

     Investment In Affiliates



     Investments in which the Company has significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee are classified as investments in affiliates on the Company's balancesheets and are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Under this method, the Company records its proportionate share of income or loss from such investments in its results for the period. Significant influence is deemed to exist wherethe Company has an investment of 20% or more in the common stock of a corporation or an investment of 3% or greater in closed end funds, limited partnerships, LLC's or similar investment vehicles. Significant influence is considered for otherstrategic investments on a case-by-case basis.

     (g) Total Investments (continued)


     The determination of whether an entity is classified as an affiliate for GAAP accounting purposes may be different from the determination of whether such entity would constitute an affiliatefor any other purposes, including regulatory purposes. The income from affiliates is shown separately between net income from operating affiliates and net income from investment affiliates. Any decline in value of an affiliate investment consideredby management to be other than temporary is charged to income in the period that it is determined.

     Other investments



     The Company accounts for its other investments which do not have readily determinable market values at estimated fair value as it has no significant influence over these entities. The netunrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments, net of tax, is included in “accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).” Any unrealized depreciation in value considered by management to be other than temporary is charged toincome in the period that it is determined.

     Securities lending



     The Company engages in a securities lending program whereby certain securities from the Company's portfolio are loaned to other institutions for short periods of time. The market value ofthe loaned securities is monitored on a daily basis, with additional collateral obtained or refunded as the market value of the loaned securities changes. The Company's policy is to require fixed maturities and initial cash collateral equal tobetween 102% and 105% of the fair value of the loaned securities depending on the class of assets loaned. The Company continues to earn interest on the securities loaned. In addition, the Company shares a portion of the interest earned on thecollateral with the lending agent. The securities lending collateral is included in cash and cash equivalents with a corresponding liability related to the Company's obligation to return the collateral plus interest included in net payable forinvestments purchased.

     (h) Cash Equivalents


     Cash equivalents include fixed interest deposits placed with a maturity of under 90 days when purchased.

     (i) Foreign Currency Translation


     Assets and liabilities of foreign operations whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated at prevailing year end exchange rates. Revenue and expenses of such foreignoperations are translated at average exchange rates during the year. The net effect of the translation adjustments for foreign operations, net of applicable deferred income taxes, as well as any gains or losses on intercompany balances for whichsettlement is not planned or anticipated in the forseeable future, are included in “accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).”

     Other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are revalued at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date and revenues and expenses are translated at theexchange rate on the date the transaction occurs with the resulting foreign exchange gains and losses recognized in income.

     (j) Intangible Assets


     Identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The Company evaluates the recoverability of its intangible assetswhenever changes in circumstances warrant it. If it is determined that an impairment exists, the excess of the unamortized balance over the fair value of the intangible asset will be charged to income at that time.

119


  XL CAPITAL LTD


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued)


     (j) Intangible Assets (continued)


     Intangible assets with an indefinite life and goodwill are not amortized. The Company continues to review the carrying value of goodwill related to all of its investments for any impairment atleast annually. If it is determined that an impairment exists, the Company adjusts the carrying value of goodwill to fair value. The impairment charge is recorded in income in the period in which it is determined. See Note 4 for furtherinformation.

     (k) Losses and Loss Expenses


     Unpaid losses and loss expenses include reserves for reported unpaid losses and loss expenses and for losses incurred but not reported. The reserve for reported unpaid losses and loss expensesfor the Company's general and financial operations is established by management based on amounts reported from insureds or ceding companies, and represents the estimated ultimate cost of events or conditions that have been reported to orspecifically identified by the Company.

     The reserve for losses incurred but not reported is estimated by management based on loss development patterns determined by reference to the Company's underwriting practices, the policyform, type of program and historical experience. The Company's actuaries employ a variety of generally accepted methodologies to determine estimated ultimate loss reserves, including the “Bornhuetter-Ferguson incurred loss method” andfrequency and severity approaches.

     Certain workers' compensation, long-term disability liabilities and financial guaranty case reserve contracts are considered fixed and determinable and are subject to tabular reserving.Reserves associated with these liabilities are discounted.

     For the Company's financial guaranty reserves, a case basis reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is recorded at the net present value of an estimated loss when, inmanagement's opinion, the likelihood of a future loss on a particular insured obligation is probable and determinable at a balance sheet date. The Company also maintains an unallocated reserve on its financial guaranty business which is basedon actuarial reserving analysis. This reserve is available to be applied to new case basis reserves that may be established for claims on current outstanding insured principal and interest in the future. This non-specific reserve is established forexpected levels of losses associated with currently insured issues and is based on a portion of premiums earned to date. The Company, on an ongoing basis, monitors these reserves and may periodically adjust such reserves based on the Company'sactual loss experience, its future mix of business, and its view of future economic conditions.

     Management believes that the reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses are sufficient to cover losses that fall within coverages assumed by the Company. However, there can be no assurancethat losses will not exceed the Company's total reserves. The methodology of estimating loss reserves is periodically reviewed to ensure that the assumptions made continue to be appropriate and any adjustments resulting there from are reflectedin income of the year in which the adjustments are made.

     (l) Deposit Liabilities


     Contracts entered into by the Company with cedents which are not deemed to transfer significant underwriting and/or timing risk are accounted for as deposits, whereby liabilities are initiallyrecorded at an amount equal to the assets received. The Company uses a portfolio rate of return of equivalent duration to the liabilities in determining risk transfer. An initial accretion rate is established based on actuarial estimates whereby thedeposit liability is increased to the estimated amount payable over the term of the contract.

120


  XL CAPITAL LTD


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued)


     (l) Deposit Liabilities (continued)


     The deposit accretion rate is the rate of return required to fund expected future payment obligations (this is equivalent to the “best estimate” of future cash flows), which aredetermined actuarially based upon the nature of the underlying indemnifiable losses. Accretion of the liability is recorded as interest expense. The Company periodically reassesses the estimated ultimate liability. Any changes to this liability arereflected as adjustments to interest expense to reflect the cumulative effect of the period the contract has been in force, and by an adjustment to the future accretion rate of the liability over the remaining estimated contract term.

     Guaranteed investment contracts are initially recorded at an amount equal to the assets received. The Company may use derivative instruments in order to hedge the Company's exposure tofluctuations in interest rates related to these contracts. Changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument are recognized in income. The change in the fair value of the hedged item, attributable to the hedged risk, is recorded as an adjustmentto the carrying amount of the hedged item and is recognized in income.

     (m) Future policy benefit reserves


     The Company estimates the present value of future policy benefits related to long duration contracts using assumptions for investment yields, mortality, and expenses, including a provision foradverse deviation.

     The assumptions used to determine future policy benefit reserves are best estimate assumptions that are determined at the inception of the contracts and are locked-in throughout the life of thecontract unless a premium deficiency develops. As the experience on the contracts emerges, the assumptions are reviewed. If such review would produce reserves in excess of those currently held then the lock-in assumptions will be revised and a claimand policy benefit is recognized at that time.

     Certain life insurance and annuity contracts provide the holder with a guaranty that the benefit received upon death will be no less than a minimum prescribed amount. The contracts areaccounted for in accordance with SOP 03-1 “Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for certain Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts”, which requires that the best estimate of future experience be combined with actualexperience to determine the benefit ratio used to calculate the policy benefit reserve.

     (n) Income Taxes


     The Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between thecarrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The deferral of tax losses is evaluated based upon management's estimates of the future profitability of theCompany's taxable entities based on current forecasts and the period for which losses may be carried forward. A valuation allowance is established for any portion of a deferred tax asset that management believes will not be realized. TheCompany continues to evaluate income generated in future periods by its subsidiaries in jurisdictions in determining the recoverability of its deferred tax asset. If it is determined that future income generated by these subsidiaries is insufficientto cause the realization of the net operating losses within a reasonable period, a valuation allowance is established at that time.

     (o) Stock Plans


     The Company accounts for stock compensation plans in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of FAS 123 “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”. This method wasadopted as of January 1, 2003 using the prospective method allowed under FAS 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and

121

     (o) Stock Plans (continued)


Disclosure” for options and employee stock purchase Plan shares granted subsequent to January 1, 2003. Prior to 2003, the Company accounted for these plans under the disclosure-only provisions of FAS 123 and nostock-based employee compensation cost was included in net income as all options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the Company's ordinary shares on the date of grant. Awards under the Company's stock plans vestover periods ranging from three to four years. If the fair value-based method had been applied to all awards since the original effective date of FAS 123, the cost related to employee stock-based compensation included in the determination of netincome would have been higher. FAS 148 amends FAS 123 by providing alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value-based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, FAS 148 amends thedisclosure requirements of FAS 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reportedresults.

     The following table illustrates the net effect on net income and earnings per ordinary share if the fair value method had been applied to all outstanding and unvested awards for each of thethree years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003:

     (r) Recent Accounting Pronouncements


     Statement of Position (“SOP”) 03-3, Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer 
(“SOP 03-3”), addresses accounting for differences between contractual cash flows and cash flows expected to be collected from an investor's initial investment in loans or debt securities acquired in atransfer if those differences are attributable, at least in part, to credit quality. SOP 03-3 limits the yield that may be accreted (accretable yield) to the excess of the investor's estimate of undiscounted expected principal, interest andother cash flows (cash flows expected at acquisition to be collected) over the investor's initial investment in the debt security. SOP 03-3 is effective for loans acquired in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2004. The adoption of SOP03-3 did not have a material effect on the Company's financial conditionor results of operations.

     In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 123 (Revised), 
Share-Based Payment

, which requires all share-basedpayments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. This statement is effective as of January 1, 2006. The Company adopted the fair value-based method ofaccounting for share-based payments effective January 1, 2003 using the prospective method described in FAS 148. FAS 123 (Revised) must be applied not only to new awards but to previously granted awards that are not fully vested on the effectivedate. However, had we adopted FAS 123 (Revised) in prior periods, the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of FAS 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in Note 2 (o) - StockPlans to our consolidated financial statements. Statement 123 (Revised) also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as requiredunder current literature. This requirement reduces net operating cash flows and increased net financing cash flows in periods after adoption.

     In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) FIN 46(R)-5, 
Implicit Variable Interests Under FASB Interpretation No. 46(R)

(“FSP FIN 46(R)-5”), which requires an enterprise to consider whether it holds an implicit variable interest in a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”) and what effect this may have on thecalculation of expected losses and residual returns of the VIE and the determination of which party, if any, is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. FSP FIN 46(R)-5 was effective for the first reporting period beginning after March 3, 2005and did not have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

     In May 2005, the FASB issued FAS No. 154, 
Accounting Changes and Error Corrections 

(“FAS 154”), which changesthe requirements for the accounting for and reporting of changes in accounting principles. FAS 154 applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principles and changes the requirements for accounting for, and reporting of, changes in accountingprinciples. FAS 154 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 2005.

     In June 2005, the FASB ratified the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 04-5, 
Determining Whether a General Partner, or the GeneralPartners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights 

(“EITF 04-5”). The EITF reached a consensus that a sole general partner is presumed tocontrol a limited partnership (or similar entity) and should consolidate the limited partnership unless (1) the limited partners possess substantive kick-out rights or (2) the limited partners possess substantive participating rights similar to therights described in EITF Issue No. 96-16, 
Investor's Accounting for an Investee When the Investor Has a Majority of the Voting Interest but the Minority Shareholders Have Certain Approval or VetoRights.
 EITF 04-5 was effective for all newand modified agreements upon the FASB's ratification in June 2005. For pre-existing agreements that are not modified, the consensus is effective as of the beginning of the firstfiscal reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company'sfinancial condition or results of operations.

     (r) Recent Accounting Pronouncements (continued)


     In July 2005, the FASB issued FSP APB 18-1, 
Accounting by an Investor for Its Proportionate Share of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income of an InvesteeAccounted for under the Equity Method In Accordance With APB Opinion No. 18 upon a Loss of Significant Influence 

(“FSP APB 18-1”), to provide guidance on how an investor should account for itsproportionate share of an investee's equity adjustments for other comprehensive income (“OCI”) upon a loss of significant influence. The FASB believes that an investor's proportionate share of an investee's equityadjustments for OCI should be offset against the carrying value of the investments at the time significant influence is lost. To the extent that the offset results in a carrying value of the investment that is less than zero, an investor should (a)reduce the carrying value of the investment to zero and (b) record the remaining balance in income. FSP APB 18-1 became effective during the fourth quarter of 2005 and did not have a material impact on the Company's financial condition orresults of operations.

     In August 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 123(R)-1, Classification and Measurement of Freestanding Financial Instruments Originally Issued in Exchange for Employee Services under FASB Statement No. 123(R
)(“FSP FAS 123(R)-1”), to defer the requirement of FAS 123(R) that afreestanding financial instrument originally subject to FAS 123(R) becomes subject to the recognition and measurement requirements of other applicable GAAP when the rights conveyed by the instrument are no longer dependent on the holder being anemployee of the entity. This FSP notes that these instruments should continue to be subject to the recognition and measurement provisions of FAS 123(R) throughout the life of the instrument, unless their terms are modified when the holder is nolonger an employee. Following modification, recognition and measurement should be determined through reference to other applicable GAAP. FSP FAS 123(R)-1 became effective during the fourth quarter of 2005 and did not have a material impact on theCompany's financial condition or results of operations.

     In November 2005, the FASB issued 
FSP FAS 115-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments 

to finalize the guidance which was initially provided in EITF 03-1, on (1) when an investment is considered impaired, (2) whether that impairment is “other-than-temporary,” (3) how to measure the impairment loss, and(4) disclosures related to impaired securities. Because of concerns about the application of EITF 03-1's guidance that described whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, the FASB deferred the effective date of that portion of EITF03-1's guidance. This FSP now officially nullifies EITF 03-1's guidance on determining whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, and effectively retains the previous guidance in this area. The FSP generally carries forward EITF03-1's guidance for determining when an investment is impaired, how to measure the impairment loss, and what disclosures should be made regarding impaired securities. The guidance is applicable as of January 1, 2006 and is not expected to havea material impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

     In November 2005, the FASB issued 
FSP FAS 123R-3, Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards

to provide a practical transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share-based payment awards to employees. This FSP stated that either the method outlined previously in FAS 123(R) or the“Short-Cut Method” outlined in the FSP, should be followed to calculate the historical pool of windfall tax benefits upon adoption of FAS 123R. The Short-Cut Method could be used to calculate the beginning balance of the APIC pool relatedto employee stock options. This FSP is effective as of November 10, 2005 and the Company must decide on whether to make the one-time accounting policy election to calculate the historical pool of windfall tax benefits available using the“short-cut” method as discussed in the FSP or the “long-form” method as outlined in FAS 123R, prior to January 1, 2007. This guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or resultsof operations.

2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued)


     (r) Recent Accounting Pronouncements (continued)


     The Company is aware of the SEC's recent review of the loss reserving practices of the financial guaranty industry. The Company recognizes that there is diversity in practice amongfinancial guaranty insurers and reinsurers with respect to their accounting policies. Current accounting literature, specifically FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 60 “Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises”(“FAS 60”) does not specifically address the unique characteristics of financial guaranty insurance contracts. Consequently, the accounting principles applied by the industry have evolved over time and incorporate the concepts of bothshort-duration and long-duration contracts accounting under the provisions of FAS 60 and other accounting literature such as FAS 5 and EITF 85-20. In June 2005, the FASB undertook a project to review this matter and provide guidance for theaccounting for financial guaranty insurance contracts under which it will consider claims liability recognition, premium recognition, and the related amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs. The Company will continue its loss reservingmethodology as noted in Note 2 (k) until further guidance is provided by the SEC or FASB. The Company had reserves for financial guaranty insurance contracts of $173.7 million and $145.3 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004,respectively.

3. Segment Information


     The Company operates through three business segments: Insurance, Reinsurance and Financial Products and Services. These business segments were determined in accordance with Statement ofFinancial Accounting Standards (“FAS”) No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.”

     Following changes in certain executive management responsibilities in January 2005, the Company changed the reporting segments under which certain business units are reported in order toreflect these changes in responsibilities.

     The following areas have been changed for all periods presented:

Results of business structured by XL Financial Solutions Ltd (“XLFS”) are now included entirely within
 the Financial Products and Services segment whereas previously this unit wasreported in all three segments, depending on the nature of individual contracts.

Certain blocks of U.S.-based term life mortality reinsurance business previously included in the Financial
 Products and Services segment are now included in the Reinsurance segment asmanagement of these contracts was transferred to the life reinsurance business units in order to centralize the Company's management of traditional mortality-basedreinsurance business.

Political risk insurance business units now report to executive management of the Financial Products and
 Services segment and, as such, future earnings from this business are no longerreported in the Insurance
 segment but included with financial operations.

All operations of business units within the Financial Products and Services segment, including guaranteed
 investment contracts and funding agreements, are now reported under financialoperations in order to consolidate businesses with similar operating characteristics and risks.

All net investment income and net income from affiliates generated by assets and interest expense incurred
 on liabilities of the business units within the Financial Products and Servicessegment is reported under
 financial operations. This income and expense is included in financial operations as it relates to interest on
 portfolios of separately identified andmanaged assets and deposit liabilities. Management believes this
 change better reflects the nature of spread focused business.

3. Segment Information (continued)

     One way in which the Company evaluates performance of each segment is based on underwriting results (
i.e., 

underwritingprofit or loss) for general operations, net income from life and annuity operations and contribution from financial operations. Other items of revenue and expenditure of the Company are not evaluated at the segment level for general operations. Inaddition, the Company does not allocate assets by segment for its general operations. Investment assets related to the Company's life and annuity, and financial operations are held in separately identified portfolios. Net investment income fromthese assets is included in net income from life and annuity operations and contribution from financial operations, respectively.

     Certain lines of business within general operations written by the Company have loss experience generally characterized as low frequency and high severity. This may result in volatility in boththe Company's results and operational cash flows.

     Insurance Operations

     General insurance business written includes risk management and specialty lines. Risk management products comprise global property and casualty insurance programs for large multinationalcompanies, including umbrella liability, products recall, U.S. workers' compensation, property catastrophe, and primary property and liability coverages. Specialty lines products include the following lines of business: professional liability,environmental liability, political risk insurance, aviation and satellite, marine and offshore energy insurance, equine and other insurance coverages including program business.

     Reinsurance Operations

     Reinsurance general business written includes treaty and facultative reinsurance to primary insurers of casualty and property risks, principally: general liability; professional liability;accident and health; automobile and workers' compensation; commercial and personal property risks; specialty risks including fidelity and surety and ocean marine; property catastrophe; property excess of loss; property pro-rata; marine andenergy; aviation and satellite; and various other reinsurance to insurers on a worldwide basis. While the Company's life and annuity reinsurance business is primarily European term assurance, group life, critical illness cover, immediateannuities in payment and disability income business, it is developing a U.S. platform.

     Financial Products and Services

     Financial products and services businesses include insurance, reinsurance and derivative solutions for complex financial risks. These include financial guaranty insurance and reinsurance,credit enhancement swaps, other collateralized transactions, weather and energy risk management products and institutional life insurance products. While each of these is unique and is tailored for the specific needs of the insured or user, they areoften multi-year contracts. Due to the nature of these types of contracts, premium volume as well as underwriting results can vary significantly from period to period. The financial products and services life business written includes fundingagreements, municipal guaranteed reinvestment contracts and highly structured life co/reinsurance transactions.

     (a) Le Mans RÉ


     Effective January 1, 2002, the Company consolidated its investment in Le Mans RÉ after increasing its ownership from 49% to 67% in order to expand its international reinsuranceoperations. Le Mans RÉ underwrites a worldwide portfolio comprising most classes of property and casualty reinsurance business, together with a selective portfolio of life reinsurance business. On September 3, 2003, the Company exercised itsoption to buy the remaining 33% ownership from Les Mutuelles du Mans Assurances Group (“MMA”) for approximately $161 million in cash and changed the name of Le Mans RÉ to XL Re Europe. Due to certain contractual arrangementsbetween the Company and MMA, MMA did not have any economic interest in the earnings of XL Re Europe with effect from January 1, 2002 and accordingly, no minority interest was recorded since that date.

     The cost of the acquisition for the increase in ownership from 49% to 67% in 2002 was approximately $188.5 million. Goodwill arising from the acquisition was approximately $52.6million. The Company recognized goodwill in excess of the fair value of XL Re Europe's net assets to increase its European franchise for its reinsurance operations. Cash paid, net of cash acquired, amounted to $45.5 million during the yearended December 31, 2002.

     Pro forma financial information and condensed balance sheet information are not presented for the acquisition of XL Re Europe because the results of XL Re Europe's operations are notsignificant to the consolidated balance sheet or consolidated results of operations of the Company.

     (b) Winterthur International


     On July 25, 2001, the Company completed the acquisition of certain Winterthur International insurance operations (the “Winterthur Business”) primarily to extend its predominantlyNorth American-based large corporate insurance business globally. The Company provisionally paid to Winterthur Swiss Insurance Company (“WSIC”) $405.6 million at closing for the Winterthur Business based on the audited U.S. GAAPfinancial statements of the Winterthur Business as at December 31, 2000 and the price was subject to final determination based on the audited U.S. GAAP financial statements of the acquired Winterthur Business operations as at June 30, 2001. InDecember 2003, the Company reached an agreement with WSIC as to the final purchase price, which was $330.2 million. As a result, $75.4 million in cash was returned to the Company.

     Under the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement, as amended, between XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd and WSIC, (the “SPA”) WSIC provided the Company with post-closing protectiondetermined as of June 30, 2004 with respect to, among other things, adverse development of reserves and premium Winterthur Business. This protection was based upon net loss experience and development over a three-year, post-closing seasoning periodbased on actual loss development experience, collectible reinsurance and certain other factors set forth in the SPA. The SPA included a process for determining the amount due from WSIC by an independent actuarial process whereby the IndependentActuary develops a value of the seasoned net reserves. The actual final seasoned amount is the submission that is closest to the number developed by the Independent Actuary.

     As the Company and WSIC were unable to come to an agreement, the Company submitted to WSIC notice to trigger the independent actuarial process as contemplated by the SPA. On February 3, 2005,both the Company and WSIC made submissions for the independent actuarial process. The Company's submission would have resulted in a net payable to the Company of approximately $1.4 billion in aggregate and WSIC submission would haveresulted in a net payable to the Company of $541 million in aggregate.

     On December 6, 2005 the Company received the report from the Independent Actuary in connection with the Company's post-closing protection. The Independent Actuary's report concludedthat WSIC submitted Seasoned Net

     (b) Winterthur International (continued)


Reserve Amount (“SNRA”) and Net Premium Receivable Amount (“NPRA”) were closest to the Independent Actuary's determinations of SNRA and NPRA. These determinations resulted in the Company receiving anet lump sum payment in the amount of approximately $575.0 million (including interest receivable) from WSIC. As the Company had recorded $1.4 billion in unpaid losses and loss expenses recoverable related to this protection, a loss ofapproximately $808.9 million, net of interest, was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005.

     In addition, WSIC provides protection to the Company with respect to third party reinsurance receivables and recoverables related to the Winterthur Business, which were $1.6 billion in theaggregate as of December 31, 2005. There are two levels of protection from WSIC for these balances:

           
    1.      

    At the time of the Winterthur International        acquisition, WSIC provided to the Company a liquidity facility. At the        time of the payment of the net reserve seasoned amount on December 12,        2005, the Company exercised its right to repay up to the balances outstanding        on this facility by assignment to WSIC of an equal amount of receivables        relating to reinsurance recoverables selected by the Company. During        December 2005, the Company assigned $265.4 million of receivables        to WSIC under this arrangement, although WSIC has disputed the assignment    of certain of these receivables.

  
       
     
     
  
       
    2.

      Under two retrocession agreements the Company        has reinsurance protection on the reinsurance recoverables with respect        to the SNRA determined as of June 30, 2004 to the extent that the Company        does not receive payment of such amounts from applicable reinsurers with        one agreement providing a limit of $1.3 billion for the insurance        written in the period to June 30, 2001 and the other agreement providing        a limit of $1.3 billion for the insurance written in the period to    December 31, 2000.

  

     At December 31, 2005, certain reinsurers responsible for some portions of the reinsurance of the Winterthur Business have raised issues as to whether amounts claimed are due and discussions arecurrently ongoing to achieve a resolution.

     The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and, therefore, the identifiable assets and liabilities of the Winterthur Business were recorded at their estimatedfair value on June 30, 2001. The process of determining the fair value of such assets and liabilities acquired, as required under purchase accounting, included management's estimates and independent valuations. The purchase price waspreliminarily allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities based upon their estimated fair value at June 30, 2001. The excess of the purchase price over acquired tangible net assets was then applied to intangible assets with finite andindefinite lives.

     This information primarily related to loss reserves, adjustment and reinstatement premiums, reinsurance balances payable and receivable and other assets and liabilities. Once the final excesspurchase price was known, the Company amended the amount attributed to goodwill by $171.0 million. The agreement reached with WSIC as to the final purchase price and related adjustments represents the completion of the Company's allocationsto the fair value of net assets. Any subsequent adjustments to the carrying value will be reflected in income in the year in which the adjustments are made.

     The revised fair value of significant assets and liabilities acquired by the Company includes $89.4 million of cash, $2.2 billion of invested assets, $1.3 billion of premiumsreceivable, $1.5 billion of unpaid losses and loss expenses recoverable, $2.8 billion of unpaid losses and loss expenses, $885 million of unearned premiums and $506

      The Company recognized    goodwill in excess of the fair value of the net assets of the acquired Winterthur    International insurance operations to increase its global platform for its    insurance operations.

      The Company estimated    the total value of intangible assets acquired at $29.8 million, including $14.7    million for insurance licenses and sales force, which have an indefinite    life and are not therefore subject to amortization. The remaining $15.1    million relates to the value of business in force, which is estimated to    have a finite life of up to nine years and is being amortized over that period.

     The significant developments in prior year loss reserve year estimates for each the years indicated within each of the Company's operating segments are discussed below.

     Insurance Segment



     During 2005, the insurance segment's net adverse prior year development of $1.02 billion includes $834.2 million of incurred loss related to the conclusion of the independentactuarial process with WSIC. Excluding this development the remaining $185.8 million was driven primarily by increases in reported case reserves for excess professional liability. Strengthening of $259.5 million in professional lines wascaused primarily by the establishment of case reserves on both directors' and officers' claims in pre-2002 business, and errors and omissions claims.

9. Losses and Loss Expenses (continued)

Strengthening of $34.7 million within other specialty lines was caused primarily by increases in reported losses for specialty lines of business currently in run-off including certain Lloyd's business, discontinuedprograms business, and surety. A net release of $112.5 million for global risks lines of business was driven by the reduction in case reserves for pre-2002 claims primarily relating to casualty business written out of Europe.

     During 2004, the Company's net adverse prior year development of $292 million was affected by increases in reported case reserves for excess professional liability, excess casualtyliability and specialty lines. These increases in reported case reserves exceeded the Company's expected losses based on historical patterns of loss development.

     Strengthening of $144 million in professional lines was caused by a few large directors' and officers' claims in pre-2002 business, while changes in errors and omissions reserveswere caused by large accounting firms and exposure to insurance/reinsurance brokers. For specialty lines, strengthening of $135 million was caused by reported loss increased in discontinued programs business with workers' compensationexposure environmental related coverages, and Lloyd's; as well as high severity claims on the surety book.

     During 2003, the Company's net adverse prior year development of $153 million was due primarily to increases in previously reported case reserves for excess professional liabilitylines of $143 million for the underwriting years 1997 through 2001. These increases in reported case reserves exceeded the Company's expected losses based on historical patterns of loss development. Specifically, the increase related toreported case reserves for directors and officers and errors and omissions coverages. During 2003, there was an increase in the amount of litigation related to certain losses. In addition, there was adverse development of $37 million related toenvironmental business primarily for professional liability coverage underwritten in 2000 and 2001 that was offset by favorable development of $27 million primarily in aviation, property, marine and energy coverages.

     The Company did not change its methodology or key assumptions used in 2005, 2004 or 2003 to determine ultimate loss reserves for any line of insurance business written.

     There is no assurance that conditions and trends that have affected the development of liabilities in the past will continue. Accordingly, it may not be appropriate to extrapolate futureredundancies or deficiencies based on the Company's historical results.

Reinsurance Segment


     During 2005, net prior year reserves across the reinsurance segment developed adversely by $94 million. Reserve strengthening of $267 million in casualty and professional lines waspartially offset by releases in other lines of business of $173 million. The casualty strengthening is primarily attributable to workers' compensation, umbrella liability and certain professional lines of business written in theCompany's North American operations. The reserve releases relate primarily to the property line where releases of $136.0 million occurred across all business units globally in the 2002 to 2004 underwriting years. Releases also occurred inthe marine and aviation classes of business across the reinsurance segment.

     The majority of the workers' compensation reserve increase during 2005 was related to an XLRA working layer program written across multiple underwriting years with a single cedent. Thisprogram was not renewed at the end of 2001. Other than this program, XLRA has not written significant working layer workers' compensation business. The remaining source of the Workers' Compensation reserve strengthening relates to anupdate of the mortality tables used in our tabular reserving methodology.

9. Losses and Loss Expenses (continued)

     The remainder of the strengthening in the casualty and professional lines reserves was driven by a small number of increases in reported claims in the other liability and errors and omissionslines of business in the pre-1997 underwriting years as well as recently reported claims in umbrella liability, errors and omissions and directors and officers lines of business in the 1997-2001 underwriting years. The professional lines claimsactivity arises largely from a limited number of cedents. This reserve increase was partially offset by favorable development in the 1997-2001 underwriting years in the medical malpractice business line. Activity in the post-2001 underwriting yearsrelates primarily to certain large individual claims affecting a number of lines, including surety, umbrella liability and errors and omissions.

     During 2004, net prior year reserves across the Reinsurance Segment developed favorably by $24 million. Releases of $144 million net in the property, aviation, marine and other lines ofbusiness were partially offset by strengthening of casualty and accident and health reserves amounted to approximately $120 million. Property catastrophe and property other reserve releases totaled approximately $95 million net relatedprimarily to the 2002 and 2003 underwriting years where loss experience has been exceptionally good for the property line. The strengthening of casualty reserves totaled $75 million and related most significantly to professional liabilityreserves in the London branch which were strengthened by $32 million for Enron and Worldcom claims. The accident & health reserve strengthening of $45 million relates to a portfolio of business underwritten by certain of theCompany's Lloyd's syndicates

     In the fourth quarter 2003, the Company reduced aviation loss reserves related to the September 11 event by $197.0 million. This reduction was due to higher than expected levels ofparticipation (97%) in the September 11 Victim Compensation Fund, a no-fault compensation scheme funded by the U.S. Government which closed on December 22, 2003. This resulted in a reduction in the estimated ultimate losses by the Company for thisevent.

     During 2003, the Company increased its estimated reserves related to its reinsurance segment (excluding the September 11 event) by $996 million of which approximately $877 millionrelated primarily to the Company's North American reinsurance operations for casualty business underwritten during the 1997 through 2001 underwriting years. Of the $877 million, $184 million was recorded in the third quarter of 2003 and$663 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 as described below.

     The main lines of business affected by this adverse development included general liability, medical malpractice, professional and surety lines. As previously noted, the Company's expectedloss development is actuarially determined based on historical claims analysis and projected trends. Actual reported losses may vary from expected loss development from quarter to quarter. Generally, as an underwriting year matures, the level ofnewly reported claims decreases and typically, unless the Company receives additional reported claims that are significantly higher or lower than expected, estimated ultimate loss reserves are not adjusted prior to a full actuarial review. In thethird quarter of 2003, the Company received a significant increase in reported claims that were in excess of the Company's expected claims development. In addition, the Company completed an actuarial review for the longer-tail lines of thisbook of business, using data evaluated at March 31, 2003. As a result, the Company recorded an increase in loss reserves of $184.0 million in the third quarter of 2003. This adverse development has been due to several factors—competitivemarket pressures on pricing during these underwriting years caused premium rates for excess casualty business to decline industry wide and there has been an increase in the number and size of claims reported in recent years as a result of increasesin court filings, corporate scandals, rising tort costs and settlement awards.

9. Losses and Loss Expenses (continued)

     As a result of this increase in prior period loss reserves in the third quarter of 2003, the Company completed an extensive claims audit review at the relevant ceding companies in order toobtain information to more accurately determine an estimate of the ultimate loss reserves for this book of business. The claims audit review included both internal and external resources, a comprehensive claims audit of the largest and mostsignificant ceding companies, and a review of loss ratios and reserve analysis procedures. Additional case reserves and potential additional loss exposure were identified during the review and upon completion of the claims review, the Companyrecorded a further increase to net loss reserves of $663.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 primarily related to the Company's North American casualty reinsurance business written in the 1997 through 2001 underwriting years. Thiscomprised additional case reserves of $124.0 million and an increase in IBNR reserves of $539.0 million.

     As a result of the new information obtained in the claims audit review, the Company performed a supplemental analysis of its North American casualty reinsurance lines of business specific tothe nature of individual cedent's circumstances. The Company separately reviewed the historical loss development of its major cedents using several actuarial methodologies; where the analysis of a cedent's experience concluded that theexperience was worse than the Company's historical loss development experience, the Company projected that cedent's ultimate loss based on the cedent's own experience. In addition, the Company assumed that the more recent experiencewas more indicative of future loss development by selecting development patterns that were based on the most recent experience rather than on the Company's or cedent's longer term historical experience.

     Prior year reserves also developed adversely on certain other casualty business written in the 1998 through 2001 underwriting years outside of North America. These exposures were affected bytrends similar to those as described above for the North American casualty reinsurance operations. The casualty exposures underwritten in these entities were much less than those of the North American operations so the impact on the prior yearreserves was relatively smaller.

     The Company has experienced significant adverse development in the casualty reinsurance business for the last several years and there can be no assurance that conditions and trends that haveaffected the development of liabilities in the past will not continue.

Financial Products and Services Segment


     The Company commenced writing financial guaranty business in 1998 and had relied entirely upon industry data to establish reserves until the end of 2001. The Company takes into account itsactual historical loss experience and revised its estimated claim reporting pattern for the unallocated losses that the Company records during each loss year. The Company uses this expected loss reporting pattern, combined with changes in reportedlosses, to determine any prior year development amount.

Other loss information


     The Company's net unpaid losses and loss expenses included estimates of actual and potential non-recoveries from reinsurers. As at December 31, 2005 and 2004, the reserve for potentialnon-recoveries from reinsurers was $260.7 million and $279.0 million, respectively.

     Except for certain workers' compensation and long-term disability liabilities, the Company does not discount its unpaid losses and loss expenses. The Company utilizes tabular reserving forworkers' compensation and long-term disability unpaid losses that are considered fixed and determinable, and discounts such losses using an interest rate of

147

9. Losses and Loss Expenses (continued)

5% (2004: 5%). The interest rate approximates the average yield to maturity on specific fixed income investments that support these liabilities. The Company decreased the interest rate from 7% to 5% in 2003.The effect of the decrease in the interest rate resulted in an increase in loss reserves of approximately $35.0 million in 2003.The tabular reserving methodology results in applying uniform and consistent criteria for establishing expected future indemnity and medical payments (including an explicit factor for inflation) andthe use of mortality tables to determine expected payment periods. Tabular unpaid losses and loss expenses, net of reinsurance, at December 31, 2005 and 2004 were $716.7 million and $578.6 million, respectively. The related discounted unpaidlosses and loss expenses were $322.2 million and $290.0 million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

     The nature of the Company's high excess of loss liability and catastrophe business can result in loss events that are both irregular and significant. Similarly, adjustments to reserves forindividual years can be irregular and significant. Such adjustments are part of the normal course of business for the Company. Conditions and trends that have affected development of liability in the past may not continue in the future. Accordingly,it is inappropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based upon historical experience.

Asbestos and Environmental Related Claims


     The Company's reserving process includes a continuing evaluation of the potential impact on unpaid liabilities from exposure to asbestos and environmental claims, including related lossadjustment expenses. Liabilities are established to cover both known and incurred but not reported claims.

     A reconciliation of the opening and closing unpaid losses and loss expenses related to asbestos and environmental exposure claims related to business written prior to 1986 for the yearsindicated is as follows:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


9. Losses and Loss Expenses (continued)

     As of December 31, 2005, the Company had approximately 878 open claim files for potential asbestos exposures and 414 open claim files for potential environmental exposures on business writtenprior to 1986. Approximately 49% of the open claim files in both 2005 and 2004 are due to precautionary claim notices. Precautionary claim notices are submitted by the ceding companies in order to preserve their right to receive coverage under the reinsurance contract. Such notices do not contain an incurred loss amount to the Company. Thedevelopment of the number of open claim files for potential asbestos and environmental claims is as follows:

  (1) Includes certain precautionary claims not    considered in 2003.

  
   
  
   


     The Company's exposure to asbestos and environmental claims arises from policies written, both on a proportional and excess basis, after 1972. The Company discontinued writing policieswith these exposures in 1985. Business written was across many different policies, each with a relatively small contract limit. The Company'sreported asbestos claims related to both traditional products and premises andoperations coverage.

     The estimation of loss and loss expense liabilities for asbestos and environmental exposures is subject to much greater uncertainty than is normally associated with the establishment ofliabilities for certain other exposures due to several factors, including: (i) uncertain legal interpretation and application of insurance and reinsurance coverage and liability; (ii) the lack of reliability of available historical claims data as anindicator of future claims development; (iii) an uncertain political climate which may impact, among other areas, the nature and amount of costs for remediating waste sites; and (iv) the potential of insurers and reinsurers to reach agreements inorder to avoid further significant legal costs. Due to the potential significance of these uncertainties, the Company believes that no meaningful range of loss and loss expense liabilities beyond recorded reserves can be established. As theCompany's net unpaid loss and loss expense reserves related to asbestos and environmental exposures are less than 1% of the total net reserves at December 31, 2005, further adverse development is not expected to be material to theCompany's overall net loss reserves. The Company believes it has made reasonable provision for its asbestos and environmental exposures and is unaware of any specific issues that would significantly affect its estimate for loss and lossexpenses.

10. Reinsurance

     The Company utilizes reinsurance and retrocession agreements principally to increase aggregate capacity and to reduce the risk of loss on business assumed. The Company's reinsurance andretrocession agreements provide for recovery of a portion of losses and loss expenses from reinsurers and reinsurance recoverables are recorded as assets. The Company is liable if the reinsurers are unable to satisfy their obligations under theagreements. Under its reinsurance security policy, the Company seeks to cede business to reinsurers generally rated “A” or better by Standard & Poor's (“S&P”) or, in the case of Lloyd's syndicates,“B+” from Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody's”). The Company considers reinsurers that are not rated or do not fall within the above rating categories and may grant exceptions to the Company's general policyon a case-by-case basis.

     The effect of reinsurance and retrocessional activity on premiums written and earned from general operations is shown below:

     At December 31, 2005, the total reinsurance assets of $7.5 billion included reinsurance recoverables for paid losses and loss expenses of $1.1 billion and $6.4 billion with respectto the ceded reserve for losses and loss expenses, including ceded losses incurred but not reported. Although the contractual obligation of individual reinsurers to pay their reinsurance obligations is based on specific contract provisions, thecollectibility of such amounts requires significant estimation by management. The majority of the balance we have accrued as recoverable will not be due for collection until sometime in the future. Over this period of time, economic conditions andoperational performance of a particular reinsurer may impact their ability to meet these obligations and while they may continue to acknowledge their contractual obligation to do so, they may not have the financial resources or willingness to fullymeet their obligation to the Company.

10. Reinsurance (continued)

     At December 31, 2005, the provision for uncollectible reinsurance was $260.7 million. To estimate this provision, the reinsurance recoverable must first be allocated to applicablereinsurers. This determination is based on a process rather than an estimate, although an element of judgment must be applied. As part of this process, ceded IBNR is allocated by reinsurer. The allocations are generally based on historicalrelationships between gross and ceded losses. If actual experience varies materially from historical experience, the allocation of reinsurance recoverable by reinsurer will change.

     The Company uses a default analysis to estimate uncollectible reinsurance. The primary components of the default analysis are reinsurance recoverable balances by reinsurer, net of collateral,and default factors used to determine the portion of a reinsurer's balance deemed uncollectible. The definition of collateral for this purpose requires some judgment and is generally limited to assets held in trust, letters of credit, andliabilities held by us with the same legal entity for which the Company believes there is a right of offset. Default factors require considerable judgment and are determined using the current rating, or rating equivalent, of each reinsurer as wellas other key considerations and assumptions.

     At December 31, 2005, the use of different assumptions within the model could have a material effect on the bad debt provision reflected in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.To the extent the creditworthiness of the Company's reinsurers was to deteriorate due to an adverse event affecting the reinsurance industry, such as a large number of major catastrophes, actual uncollectible amounts could be significantlygreater than the Company's bad debt provision. Such an event could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.

     Included in unpaid loss and loss expenses recoverable at December 31, 2004, was an unsecured reinsurance recoverable from Winterthur Swiss Insurance Company (the “WSIC”) of $1.45billion, related to certain contractual arrangements in the sale and purchase agreement (“SPA”), as amended, relating to the Company's acquisition of certain Winterthur International insurance operations (the “WinterthurBusiness”) in July 2001. The conclusion of the Independent actuarial process resulted in the Company receiving a net lump sum payment for 2005, in the amount of approximately $575.0 million, net of interest.

     In addition, WSIC provides protection to the Company with respect to third party reinsurance receivables and recoverables related to the Winterthur Business, which are $1.6 billion in theaggregate as of December 31, 2005. There are two levels of protection from WSIC for these balances:

   
        1.
              
        At the time of the Winterthur International acquisition, WSIC provided to the Company a liquidity facil- ity. At the time of the payment of the net reserve seasoned amount on December 12, 2005, the Company exercised itsright to repay up to the balances outstanding on this facility by assignment to WSIC of an equal amount of receivables relating to reinsurance recoverables selected by the Company. During December 2005, the Company assigned $265.4 million ofreceivables to WSIC under this arrangement, although WSIC has disputed the assignment of certain of these receivables.
   

 

   
        2.
              
        Under two retrocession agreements the Company has reinsurance protection on the reinsurance recover- ables with respect to the Seasoned Net Reserves Amount determined as of June 30, 2004 to the extent that the Company doesnot receive payment of such amounts from applicable reinsurers with one agree- ment providing a limit of $1.3 billion for the insurance written in the period to June 30, 2001 and the other agreement providing a limit of $1.3 billion for theinsurance written in the period to December 31, 2000.

11. Deposit Liabilities

     At December 31, 2005, certain reinsurers responsible for some portions of the reinsurance of the acquired Winterthur Business have raised issues as to whether amounts claimed are due anddiscussions are currently ongoing to achieve a resolution.

     The Company has entered into certain contracts with cedents that transfer insufficient risk to be accounted for as insurance or reinsurance transactions. These contracts have been recorded asdeposit liabilities and are matched by an equivalent amount of investments. The Company has investment risk related to its ability to generate sufficient investment income to enable the total invested assets to cover the payment of the estimatedultimate liability. The Company establishes an initial accretion rate at inception of the contract, which is reviewed and adjusted periodically based on claims activity. Guaranteed investment contracts are initially recorded at an amount equal tothe assets received. The Company also has investment risk related to its ability to generate sufficient investment income to enable the total invested assets to cover the payment of the estimated ultimate liability. The Company establishes aninitial accretion rate at inception of the contract, which is based on the contractual payment schedule.

Total deposit liabilities are comprised of the following:

     Interest expense of $227.7 million, $143.6 million and $105.1 million was recorded related to the accretion of deposit liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and2003, respectively.

12. Future Policy Benefit Reserves

     During 2005 and 2004, the Company entered into long duration contracts that subject the Company to mortality and morbidity risks and which were accounted for as life premiums earned. Futurepolicy benefit reserves were established using appropriate assumptions for investment yields, mortality, and expenses, including a provision for adverse deviation. The average interest rate used for the determination of the future policy benefitsfor these contracts was 4.8% and 5.1% at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Total future policy benefit reserves for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 were $5.6 and $4.3 billion, respectively. Substantially all of thesereserves relate to closed blocks of annuities.

13. Notes Payable and Debt and Financing Arrangements


     As at December 31, 2005, the Company had bank and loan facilities available from a variety of sources, including commercial banks, totaling $4.6 billion (2004: $3.4 billion) of which$3.4 billion (2004: $2.7 billion) of debt was outstanding. In addition, the Company has letter of credit facilities totaling $5.5 billion available of which $3.5 billion (2004: $3.0 billion) were outstanding as at December 31,2005, 5.3% (2004: 6.6%) of which were collateralized by the Company's investment portfolio, supporting U.S. non-admitted business and the Company's Lloyd's Syndicates' capital requirements. Of these amounts, $1.0 billion isavailable in the form of revolving credit or letters of credit.

     $45 million was drawn under the syndicated revolving credit facility at December 31, 2005 at an average interest rate in 2005 of 4.5%, and this amount was repaid in January 2006. There wereno borrowings or repayments under the Company's revolving credit facilities during 2004.

     In December 2005, the Company created a new $100 million unsecured bilateral credit facility that was unutilized during 2005 and at December 31, 2005. The full amount of $100 million isavailable as both revolving credit and letters of credit, with the combined total not to exceed $100 million.

     In December 2005, the Company issued 29.8 million 7.0% Equity Security Units (the “7.0% Units”) in a public offering. The Company received approximately $722.7 million in netproceeds from the sale of the 7.0% Units after deducting underwriting discounts. Each 7.0% Unit has a stated amount of $25 and consists of (a) a purchase contract pursuant to which the holder agreed to purchase, for $25, a variable number ofshares of the Company's Class A Ordinary Shares on February 15, 2009 and (b) a one-fortieth, or 2.5%, ownership interest in a senior note issued by the Company due February 15, 2011 with a principal amount of $1,000. The senior notes arepledged by the holders to secure their obligations under the purchase contract. The number of shares issued under the purchase contract is contingently adjustable based on, among other things, the share price of the Company on the stock purchasedate and the dividend rate of the Company. The Company will make quarterly payments at the annual rate of 1.75% and 5.25% under the purchase contracts and senior notes, respectively. The Company may defer the contract payments on the purchasecontract, but not the senior notes, until the stock purchase date. In February 2009, the senior notes will be remarketed whereby the interest rate on the senior notes will be reset in order to generate sufficient remarketing proceeds to satisfy the7.0% Unit holders' obligations under the purchase contract. If the senior notes are not successfully remarketed, then the Company will exercise its rights as a secured party and may retain or dispose of the senior notes to satisfy, in full, the7.0% Unit holders' obligations to purchase its ordinary shares under the purchase contracts.

     In connection with this transaction, $36.9 million, which is the estimated fair value of the purchase contract, was charged to “Additional paid in capital” and a correspondingliability was established. Of the $23.9 million total costs associated with the issuance of the 7.0% Units, $21.1 million was charged to “Additional paid in capital” with the remainder deferred and amortized over the term of thesenior debt.

     The number of ordinary shares to be issued under each purchase contract depends on, among other things, the average market price of the ordinary shares. The maximum number of ordinary shares tobe issued under the purchase contracts is approximately 11.5 million. The Company accounts for the effect on the number of weighted average ordinary shares, assuming dilution, using the treasury stock method. The purchase contract component of the7.0% Units will have no effect on the number of weighted average ordinary shares, assuming dilution, except when the average market price of the Company's ordinary shares is above the threshold appreciation price of $80.6 per share. Becausethe average market price of the Company's ordinary shares during the period the 7.0% Units were outstanding was below this price, the shares issuable under the purchase contracts were excluded from the computation of net income per ordinaryshare assuming dilution for the three and twelve month periods ended December 31, 2005.

     In November 2005, the Company repaid its 7.15% senior notes on maturity.

     In September 2005, the Company renewed an unsecured bilateral credit facility of $150 million (previously $200 million) that was fully utilized at December 31, 2005.

     In August 2005, the Company created a new unsecured bilateral credit facility of $100 million that was unutilized at December 31, 2005.

rate of the Company. The Company will make quarterly payments at the annual rate of 3.97% and 2.53% under the purchase contracts and senior notes, respectively.

The maximum number of ordinary shares tobe issued under the purchase contracts is approximately 11 million. The Company accounts for the effect on the number of weighted average ordinary shares, assuming dilution, using the treasury stock method.

The issued securities and the Company's repayment obligations are recorded as a net balance on the Company's balance sheet.

In the event that such credit support is insufficient, the Company could be required to provide alternative security to cedents. This could take the form of additional insurance trusts supported by the Company'sinvestment portfolio or funds withheld using the Company's cash resources. The value of letters of credit required is driven by, among other

things, loss development of existing reserves, the payment pattern of such reserves, the expansion of business written by the Company and the loss experience of such business.

     In general, all of the Company's bank facilities, indentures and other documents relating to the Company's outstanding indebtedness (collectively, the “Company's DebtDocuments”), as described above, contain cross default provisions to each other and the Company's Debt Documents (other than the 6.5% Guaranteed Senior Notes indentures) contain affirmative covenants. These covenants provide for, amongother things, minimum required ratings of the Company's insurance and reinsurance operating subsidiaries (other than its “AAA” financial guaranty companies) and the level of secured indebtedness in the future. In addition, generallyeach of the Company's Debt Documents provide for an event of default in the event of a change of control of the Company or some events involving bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company. The Company's credit facilities andthe 6.58% Guaranteed Senior Notes also contain minimum consolidated net worth covenants.

     Under the Company's 364-day facilities, 3-year credit facility, five-year credit facilities placement notes described above, in the event that the Company XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd and XLRe Ltd fail to maintain a financial strength rating of at least “A-” from A.M. Best, an event of default would occur. The Company currently has an “A+ (stable)” rating from A.M. Best.

     Under the Company's ten-year private placement notes described above, in the event that the Company fails to maintain a financial strength rating of at least “A” from A.M. Bestor XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd and XL Re Ltd fail to maintain a financial strength rating of at least “A” from S&P, an event of default would occur. The Company and its subsidiaries currently have an “A+” (stable) rating fromA.M. Best and “A+” (stable) from S&P.

     The 6.5% Guaranteed Senior Notes indentures contain a cross default provision. In general, in the event that the Company defaults in the payment of indebtedness in the amount of $50.0million or more, an event of default would be triggered under both the 6.5% Guaranteed Senior Notes indentures.

     Given that all of the Company's Debt Documents contain cross default provisions, this may result in all holders declaring such debt due and payable and an acceleration of all debt dueunder those documents. If this were to occur, the Company may not have funds sufficient at that time to repay any or all of such indebtedness.

     In addition, the Company's unsecured Lloyd's letter of credit facility provides that, in the event that the Company's insurance and reinsurance rated operating subsidiaries inBermuda fall below “A” (as measured by the financial strength rating from A.M. Best at any time), the facility would then be required to be fully secured by the Company, at which time the Company would be required to either (i) provide anamount in cash to cover an amount equal to the aggregate letters of credit outstanding at that time or (ii) deposit assets in trust securing 105% of the aggregate letters of credit outstanding at that time. If this were to occur, the Company may notbe able to provide the collateral required in order to maintain this facility.

(a) Credit Derivatives

     Credit derivatives are recorded at fair value. In determining the fair value of credit derivatives, management differentiates between investment and non-investment grade exposures and modelsthem separately. Management estimates fair value for investment grade exposures by monitoring changes in credit quality and selecting appropriate market indices to determine credit spread movements over the life of the contracts. The determinationof the credit spread movements is the basis for calculating the fair value. For credit derivatives that are non-investment grade appropriate market indices are not readily available. Accordingly, the Company uses an alternative fair valuemethodology.

     Under this methodology, the fair value is determined using a cash flow model developed by the Company which is dependent upon a number of factors, including changes in interest rates, futuredefault rates, credit spreads, changes in credit quality, future expected recovery rates and other market factors. In general, the Company holds credit derivatives to maturity. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of such credit derivatives areunrealized. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 the change in the fair value of credit derivatives issued in connection with the Company's financial guaranty business was a gain of $10.5 million, $48.3 million and$7.8 million, respectively.

(b) Weather and Energy Derivatives


     Weather and energy derivatives are recorded at fair value, which is determined through the use of quoted market prices where available. Where quoted market prices are unavailable, the fairvalues are estimated using available market data and internal pricing models based upon consistent statistical methodologies. Estimating fair value of instruments that do not have quoted market prices requires management's judgment indetermining amounts that could reasonably be expected to be received from, or paid to, a third party in settlement of the contracts. The amounts could be materially different from the amounts that might be realized in an actual sale transaction.Fair values are subject to change in the near-term and reflect management's best estimate based on various factors including, but not limited to, actual and forecasted weather conditions, changes in commodity prices, changes in interest ratesand other market factors.

     The change in fair value recorded for the weather and energy derivatives was a gain of $17.8 million, $2.0 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and2003, respectively.

(c) Investment Derivatives, Including Embedded Derivatives


     The Company uses foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to the effects of fluctuating foreign currencies on the value of certain of its foreign currency fixed maturities and equitysecurities investments. These contracts are not designated as specific hedges for financial reporting purposes and therefore, realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in income in the period in which they occur. Thesecontracts generally have maturities of twelve months or less. In addition, certain of the Company's investment managers may, subject to investment guidelines, enter into forward contracts where potential gains may exist. The Company hasexposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through its operations and in its investment portfolio. The Company's net foreign currency denominated payable on foreign exchange contracts was $603.0 million and 3.8 million as atDecember 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, with a net unrealized gain of $15.9 million as at December 31, 2005 and a net unrealized loss of $11.8 million as at December 31, 2004.

     The Company also uses foreign exchange forward contracts, in certain cases to hedge net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. The Company manages itsconsolidated net foreign exchange exposure and from time to time hedges specific net in foreign operations. The Company measures ineffectiveness based upon the change in forward rates. For the year ended December 31, 2005, $30.3 million of netrealized and unrealized losses related to these foreign exchange forward contracts and were included in the cumulative translation adjustment. As at December 31, 2005 the net unrealized gain position of these contracts was $13.4 million on atotal contract value of $141.2 million. For the same period, no net losses were recorded in earnings representing the amount of the hedges' ineffectiveness as the change in the value of the forward contract was fully offset by acorresponding change in the underlying investment.

     (d) Interest Rate Exposure


     The Company utilizes a risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative financial instruments, primarily to reduce its exposure to interest rate risks associated with certain ofits assets and liabilities. The Company uses interest rate swaps to convert certain liabilities from a fixed rate to a variable rate of interest and to convert a variable rate of interest from one basis to another. The Company is exposed to creditrisk in the event of non-performance by the other parties to the forward contracts.

     The Company designates certain of its derivative instruments as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges and formally and contemporaneously documents all relationships between the hedginginstruments and hedged items and links the hedge to specific assets and liabilities. The Company assesses the effectiveness of the hedge, both at inception and on an on-going basis and determines whether the hedge is highly effective in offsettingchanges in fair value or cash flows of the linked hedged item.

     At December 31, 2005, contracts designated as fair value and cash flow hedges were in a $23.5 million net unrealized gain position. As a result of the fair value hedges, deposit liabilitieswere increased by $27.6 million at December 31, 2005. The ineffective portion of the hedge amounted to $5.0 million as part of net realized losses. The interest rate swap hedges resulted in a reduction in interest expense and a reduction innet investment income of $6.7 million and $4.5 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2005.

     At December 31, 2004, contracts designated as fair value and cash flow hedges were in a $13.4 million net unrealized gain position. As a result of the fair value hedges, deposit liabilitieswere increased by $19.9 million at December 31, 2004. The ineffective portion of the hedge amounted to $1.8 million as part of net realized losses. The interest rate swap hedges resulted in a reduction in interest expense and a reduction innet investment income of $14.8 million and $4.4 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2004.

     At December 31, 2003, contracts designated as fair value and cash flow hedges were in a $3.2 million net unrealized gain position. As a result of the fair value hedges, deposit liabilitieswere increased by $3.1 million at December 31, 2003. The ineffective portion of the hedge amounted to $0.1 million as part of net realized gains. The interest rate swap hedges resulted in a reduction in interest expense of $2.6 millionfor the year ended December 31, 2003.

     In August 2004, the Company entered into a treasury rate guarantee agreement in anticipation of the issuance of fixed-rate debt. This transaction, which met the requirements of a cash flowhedge of a forecasted transaction under SFAS No. 133, “
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

”, was entered into to mitigate the interest raterisk associated with the subsequent issuance of $300.0 million of 5.25% Senior Notes due September 15, 2014 (see Note 8 above). The loss on the settlement of the treasury rate guarantee transaction on August 18, 2004 of $6.3 million wascharged to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income and is being amortized to interest expense over the 10-year term of the related debt.

     In 2002, the Company entered into a treasury rate lock agreement with the underwriters of the 6.50% Guaranteed Senior Notes due 2012 (2001: 6.58% Guaranteed Senior Notes due 2011). The Notes were priced using a margin over the yield of a U.S. Treasury note with a similar maturity. The treasury rate lock agreement wasdesigned to eliminate underlying pricing risk of the Company's debt that would have resulted from an increase in the yield of the comparable U.S. Treasury issue between the initiation of the transaction and the pricing of the transaction. Thetotal cost of the hedge was $4.2 million. In 2001, a loss of $5.6 million was recorded in net realized and unrealized

gains and losses related to the cancellation of the treasury lock agreement relating to the 6.58% notes due 2011 due to the September 11, 2001 event.

     (e) Financial Market Exposure


     The Company also uses bond and stock index futures to add value to the portfolio where market inefficiencies are believed to exist, to equitize cash holdings of equity managers and to adjustthe duration of a portfolio of fixed income securities to match the duration of related deposit liabilities. These instruments are marked to market on a daily basis and changes in fair values are recorded through net realized and unrealized gainsand losses on derivative instruments. The Company measures potential losses in fair values using various statistical techniques.

     (f) Other Derivatives


     The Company holds warrants in conjunction with certain of its other investments. These warrants are recorded at fair value based on quoted market prices.

     The Company also has investment related derivatives embedded in certain reinsurance contracts. For a particular life reinsurance contract, the Company pays the ceding company a fixed amountequal to the estimated present value of the excess of guaranteed benefit (“GMIB”) over the account balance upon the policyholder's election to take the income benefit. The fair value of this derivative is determined based on thepresent value of expected cash flows. In addition, the Company has modified coinsurance and funds withheld reinsurance agreements that provide for a return based on a portfolio of fixed income securities; as such, the agreements contain embeddedderivatives. The embedded derivative is bifurcated from the funds withheld balance and recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings.

15. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements


     In December 2004, XLFA entered into a put option agreement and an asset trust expense reimbursement agreement with the Asset Trust. The put option agreement provides XLFA with the irrevocableright to require the Asset Trust at any time and from time to time to purchase XLFA's non-cumulative perpetual Series B Preferred Shares with an aggregate liquidation preference of up to $200 million. XLFA is obligated to reimburse theAsset Trust for certain fees and ordinary expenses. To the extent that any Series B Preferred Shares are put to the Asset Trust and remain outstanding, a corresponding portion of such fees and ordinary expenses will be payable by XLFA pursuant tothe asset trust expense reimbursement agreement. The put option agreement is perpetual but would terminate on delivery of notice by XLFA on or after December 9, 2009, or under certain defined circumstances, such as the failure of XLFA to pay the putoption premium when due or bankruptcy. The put option is recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings.

     In 2003, the Company entered into an aggregate of $500.0 million of commercial paper-based credit facilities (the “Credit Facilities”). The proceeds of advances under the CreditFacilities were used to fund a trust account (“Trust”) to collateralize the reinsurance obligations of the Company under an intercompany quota share reinsurance agreement. The issued securities and the Company's repayment obligationsare recorded as a net balance on the Company's balance sheet because the Company has a contractual legal right of offset. In the event that in the future the Company were to not have the right to offset such assets (as, for example, would bethe case if the assets in the Trust were withdrawn in order to satisfy the Company's reinsurance obligations or if lender-issued securities could

not be held in the Trust because they did not qualify as permitted assets under the trust agreement), then all or a portion of the assets in the Trust and the Company's repayment obligations under the Credit Facilitieswould be required to be included as assets and liabilities on a gross basis, respectively, on the Company's balance sheet.

     In July 2003, the Company entered into a contingent capital transaction with an aggregate value of $500.0 million. This transaction also provides the Company with an insurance trust thatprovides the Company with statutory relief under state insurance regulations in the U.S. Under the terms of this facility, the Company has acquired an irrevocable put option to issue preference ordinary shares into a trust in return for proceedsraised from investors. This put option may be exercised by the Company at any time. In addition, the Company may be required to issue preference ordinary shares to the trust under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, the non-paymentof the put option premium and a ratings downgrade of the Company.

16. Variable Interest Entities


     The Company utilizes variable interest entities both indirectly and directly in the ordinary course of business. The Company provides various forms of credit enhancement including financialguaranty insurance and reinsurance of structured transactions backed by pools of assets of specified types, municipal obligations supported by the issuers' ability to charge fees for specified services or projects, and structured single riskbased obligations including essential infrastructure projects and obligations backed by receivables from future sales of commodities and other specified services. The obligations related to these transactions are often securitized through variableinterest entities. In synthetic transactions the Company guarantees payment obligations of counterparties including special purpose vehicles under credit derivatives referencing asset portfolios. The Company invests in equity tranches (or similarinstruments) of collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”), collateralized bond obligations (“CBOs”) and other investment vehicles that are issued through variable interest entities as part of the Company's risk assetportfolio.

17. Exposures under Guaranties


     The Company provides and reinsures financial guaranties issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements. Financial guaranties are conditional commitments that guarantee theperformance of an obligor to a third party, typically the timely repayment of principal and interest. The Company's potential liability in the event of non- payment by the issuer of the insured obligation is represented by its proportionateshare of the aggregate outstanding principal and interest payable (“insurance in force”) on such insured obligation. In synthetic transactions, the Company guarantees payment obligations of counterparties under credit derivatives. Thefuture value of installment premiums for such guarantees totaled approximately $652.0 million and $505.8 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The range of maturity of the insured obligations is one to thirty-five years. TheCompany does not record a carrying value for future installment premiums as they are recognized over the term of the contract.

     The Company manages its exposures to underwriting risk on these transactions through a structured process which includes but is not limited to detailed credit analysis, review of and adherenceto underwriting guidelines and the use of reinsurance. The Company has also implemented surveillance policies and procedures to monitor its exposure throughout the life of the transactions. In addition, the structures of the transactions are suchthat the insured obligation is backed by a stream of cash flows, pools of assets or some other form of collateral. This collateral would typically become the Company's upon the payment of a claim by the Company.

18. Commitments and Contingencies


     (a) Concentrations of Credit Risk


     The creditworthiness of any counterparty is evaluated by the Company, taking into account credit ratings assigned by rating agencies. The credit approval process involves an assessment offactors including, among others, the counterparty, country and industry credit exposure limits. Collateral may be required, at the discretion of the Company, on certain transactions based on the creditworthiness of the counterparty.

     The areas where significant concentrations of credit risk may exist include unpaid losses and loss expenses recoverable and reinsurance balances receivable (collectively, “reinsuranceassets”), investments and cash and cash equivalent balances. The Company's reinsurance assets at December 31, 2005 and 2004 amounted to $7.5 billion and $7.8 billion respectively and resulted from reinsurance arrangements in thecourse of its operations. A credit exposure exists with respect to reinsurance assets as they may be uncollectible. The Company manages its credit risk in its reinsurance relationships by transacting with reinsurers that it considers financiallysound, and if necessary, the Company may hold collateral in the form of funds, trust accounts and/or irrevocable letters of credit. This collateral can be drawn on for amounts that remain unpaid beyond specified time periods on an individualreinsurer basis.

     In addition, the Company underwrites a significant amount of its general insurance and reinsurance business through brokers and a credit risk exists should any of these brokers be unable tofulfill their contractual obligations with respect to the payments of insurance and reinsurance balances to the Company. During the three years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, approximately 21%, 22% and 24%, respectively, of theCompany's consolidated gross written premiums from general operations were generated from or placed by Marsh & McLennan Companies. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, approximately 17%, 17% and 17%, respectively, of the Company's consolidatedgross written premiums from general operations were generated from or placed by AON Corporation and its subsidiaries. Both of these companies are large, well established companies and there are no indications that either of them is financiallytroubled. No other broker and no one insured or reinsured accounted for more than 10% of gross premiums written from general operations in any of the three years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, or 2003.

     The Company's available for sale investment portfolio is managed by external managers in accordance with guidelines that have been tailored to meet specific investment strategies,including standards of diversification, which limit the allowable holdings of any single issue. The Company did not have an aggregate investment in a single entity, other than the U.S. Government, in excess of 10% of the Company'sshareholders' equity at December 31, 2005, 2004, or 2003.

     On July 25, 2001, the Company completed the acquisition of certain Winterthur International insurance operations (the “Winterthur Business”) primarily to extend its predominantlyNorth American-based large corporate insurance business globally.

     As a part of this transaction the WSIC provides protection to the Company with respect to third party reinsurance receivables and recoverables related to the Winterthur Business, which are$1.6 billion in the aggregate as of December 31, 2005. There are two levels of protection from WSIC for these balances:

   
        1.
              
        At the time of the Winterthur International acquisition, the seller provided to the Company a liquidity facil- ity. At the time of the payment of the net reserve seasoned amount on December 12, 2005, as described above, theCompany exercised its right to repay up to the balances outstanding on this facility by assign- ment to WSIC of an equal amount of receivables relating to reinsurance recoverables selected by the Company. During December 2005, the Company assigned$265.4 million of receivables to WSIC under this arrangement, although WSIC has disputed the assignment of certain of these receivables.
     

 

   
        2.
              
        Under two retrocession agreements the Company has reinsurance protection on reinsurance recoverables with respect to the seasoned net reserved amount as of June 30, 2004 to the extent that the Company does not receivepayment of such amounts from applicable reinsurers with one agreement providing a limit of $1.3 billion for the insurance written in the period to June 30, 2001 and the other agreement providing a limit of $1.3 billion for the insurancewritten in the period to December 31, 2000.

     (e) Tax Matters


     The Company is a Cayman Islands corporation and, except as described below, neither it nor its non-U.S. subsidiaries have paid United States corporate income taxes (other than withholding taxeson dividend income) on the basis that they are not engaged in a trade or business or otherwise subject to taxation in the United States. However, because definitive identification of activities which constitute being engaged in a trade or businessin the United States is not provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, regulations or court decisions, there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service will not contend that the Company or its non-U.S. subsidiaries are engaged in atrade or business or otherwise subject to taxation in the United States. If the Company or its non-U.S. subsidiaries were considered to be engaged in a trade or business in the United States (and, if the Company or such subsidiaries were to qualifyfor the benefits under the income tax treaty between the United States and Bermuda and other countries in which the Company operates, such businesses were attributable to a “permanent establishment” in the United States), the Company orsuch subsidiaries could be subject to U.S. tax at regular tax rates on its taxable income that is effectively connected with its U.S. trade or business plus an additional 30% “branch profits” tax on such income remaining after the regulartax, in which case there could be a significant adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.

(f) Letters of Credit

     At December 31, 2005 and 2004, $3.5 billion and $3.0 billion of letters of credit, respectively, were outstanding, 5.3% and 6.6% of which were collateralized by the Company'sinvestment portfolio, supporting U.S. non-admitted business and the Company's Lloyd's Syndicates' capital requirements.

     (c) Stock Plans


     The Company's 1991 Performance Incentive Program, as amended and restated effective March 7, 2003, provides for grants of non-qualified or incentive stockoptions, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units and stock appreciation rights (“SARs”). The plan is administered by the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.Stock options may be granted with or without SARs. No SARs have been granted to date. Grant prices are established at the fair market value of the Company's common stock at the date of grant. Options and SARs have a life of not longer than tenyears and vest as set forth at the time of grant. Options currently vest annually over three or four years from date of grant.

     The Company's 1999 Performance Incentive Program for Employees (the “1999Program”) provides for grants of non-statutory stock options, restricted stock,performance shares and performance units to employees of the Company and itssubsidiaries who are not subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The 1999 Program is administered by theBoard of Directors of the Company or the Compensation Committee, as determinedfrom time to time by the Board of Directors.

     Restricted stock awards issued under the 1991 and 1999 Performance Incentive Program, vest as set forth in the applicable award agreements. These shares contained certain restrictions, prior to vesting,relating to, among other things, forfeiture in the event of termination of employment and transferability. As the shares are issued, deferred compensation equivalent to the fair market value on the date of the grant is charged to shareholders'equity and subsequently amortized over the vesting period. Restricted stock issued under these plans totaled 895,484 shares, 660,535 shares, and 500,432 shares in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

     Prior to December 31, 2003, all options granted to non-employee directors were granted under the 1991 Performance Incentive Program. In 2004, these options were granted under the DirectorsStock & Option Plan. All options vest immediately on the grant date. Directors may also make an irrevocable election preceding the beginning of each fiscal year to defer cash compensation that would otherwise be payable as his or her annualretainer in increments of 10%. The deferred payments are credited in the form of ordinary share units calculated by dividing 110% of the deferred payment by the market value of the Company's stock on the date the compensation would otherwisehave been paid. These shares are distributed under the terms of the plan. Shares issued under the plan totaled 3,814, 3,819, and 3,153 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

     A second stock plan is provided for the directors that grants share units equal to their annual retainer divided by the market price of the Company's ordinary stock on January 1 of eachyear.

     Following the merger with NAC, new option plans were created in the Company to adopt the plans. Options generally have a five or six year vesting schedule, with the majority expiring ten yearsfrom the date of grant; the remainder having no expiration. A stock plan is also maintained for non-employee directors. Options expire ten years from the date of grant and are fully exercisable six months after their grant date.

     In 1999, the Company adopted the 1999 Performance Incentive Plan under which 1,250,000 options were available for issuance to employees who were not directors or executive officers of theCompany.

Employees who enrolled in the ESPP may purchase the Company's shares at a 15% discount on the lesser of the marketprice at the beginning or at the end of the six month offering period. Once purchased, employees can sell or transfer their shares to someone else's name only during an Open Trading Window. Participants in the ESPP are eligible to receivedividends on the Company's shares. A total of 1,255,000 ordinary shares may be issued under the ESPP.

     (f) Voting


     The Company's Articles of Association restrict the voting power of any person to less than approximately 10% of total voting power.

     (g) Share Rights Plan


     Rights to purchase Class A ordinary shares (the “Rights”) were distributed as a dividend at the rate of one Right for each Class A ordinary share held of record as of the close ofbusiness on October 31, 1998. Each Right entitles holders of Class A ordinary shares to buy one ordinary share at an exercise price of $350. The Rights would be exercisable, and would detach from the Class A ordinary shares, only if a person orgroup were to acquire 20% or more of the Company's outstanding Class A ordinary shares, or were to announce a tender or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in a person or group beneficially owning 20% or more of Class A ordinaryshares. Upon a person or group without prior approval of the Board acquiring 20% or more of Class A ordinary shares, each Right would entitle the holder (other than such an acquiring person or group) to purchase Class A ordinary shares (or, incertain circumstances, Class A ordinary shares of the acquiring person) with a value of twice the Rights exercise price upon payment of the Rights exercise price. The Company will be entitled to redeem the Rights at $0.01 per Right at any timeuntil the close of business on the tenth day after the Rights become exercisable. The Rights will expire at the close of business on September 30, 2008, and do not have a fair value. The Company has reserved 119,073,878 Class A ordinary shares beingauthorized and unissued for issue upon exercise of Rights.

20. Retirement Plans


     The Company maintains both defined contribution and defined benefit retirement plans, which vary for each subsidiary. Plan assets are invested principally in equity securities and fixedmaturities.

     The Company has a qualified defined contribution plan which is managed externally and whereby employees and the Company contribute a certain percentage of the employee's gross salary intothe plan each month. The Company's contribution generally vests over 5 years. The Company's expenses for its qualified contributory defined contribution retirement plans were $40.9 million, $38.8 million and $27.5 million inthe years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

     A qualified non-contributory defined benefit pension plan exists to cover a number of its U.S. employees. This plan also includes a non-qualified supplemental defined benefit plan designed tocompensate individuals to the extent their benefits under the Company's qualified plan are curtailed due to Internal Revenue Code limitations. Benefits are based on years of service and compensation, as defined in the plan, during the highestconsecutive three years of the employee's last ten years of employment. Under these plans, the Company's policy is to make annual contributions to the plan that are deductible for federal income tax purposes and that meet the minimumfunding standards required by law. The contribution level is determined by utilizing the entry age cost method and different actuarial assumptions than those used for pension expense purposes. The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefitobligation and fair value of the assets for this plan with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $29.4 million, $29.4 million and $14.2 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2005, and $27.0 million,$27.0 million and $13.8 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2004.

     In the first quarter of 2002, the Company curtailed its qualified non-contributory defined benefit plan. Under the terms of the curtailment, eligible employees will not earn additional definedbenefits for future services. However,

future service may be counted toward vesting of benefits which accumulated based on past service. The Company recognized a benefit of $9.9 million associated with this curtailment gain.

     During 2003, all pension benefits and retirement plans for Winterthur International employees were transitioned into the Company's defined contribution plan.

23. Taxation (continued)

     The valuation allowance at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 of $154.5 million and $68.6 million, respectively, relates to net operating loss carry forwards in Switzerland andAustralia and net unrealized capital losses and realized capital loss carry forwards in the U.S. that may not be realized within a reasonable period. As of December 31, 2005, the Company has net unrealized capital losses and realized capital losscarry forwards of approximately $56.2 million and $22 million respectively in the U.S., against which a valuation allowance of $23.7 million has been established. Management believes it is more likely than not that the tax benefit of theremaining net deferred tax assets will be realized.

     U.S. net operating loss carry forwards at December 31, 2005 were approximately $18.4 million and will expire in future years through 2024. As of December 31, 2005, net operating loss carryforwards in the U.K. were approximately $332 million and have no expiration. As of December 31, 2005, net operating loss carry forwards in Switzerland were approximately $554 million and will expire in future years through 2012.

     Management is required to determine if there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset attributable to its U.S. group and UK groupnet operating losses would be utilized within a reasonable period. Management has reviewed historical taxable income and future taxable income projections for its U.S. group and its UK group and has determined that in its judgment, the net operatinglosses will more likely than not be realized as reductions of future taxable income within a reasonable period. Specifically with regard to the U.S. group, management has determined that the projected U.S. consolidated taxable income will besufficient to utilize the net operating losses of approximately $18.4 million within a reasonable period. With regard to the UK group, management has determined that the projected UK group taxable income (using UK rules for group loss relief)will be sufficient to utilize the net operating losses of approximately $332 million. Management will continue to evaluate income generated in future periods by the U.S. group and the UK group in determining the reasonableness of its position.If management determines that future income generated by the U.S. group or UK group is insufficient to cause the realization of the net operating losses within a reasonable period, a valuation allowance would be required for the U.S. portion of thenet deferred tax asset, in the amount of $6.4 million and for the UK portion of the net deferred tax asset, in the amount of $99.6 million.

     Effective as of January 1, 2004, XL Re America Inc (“XLRA”), a member of the U.S. group, entered into an adverse development reinsurance treaty with another non U.S. reinsurancesubsidiary of the Company. The treaty related to the 1985 through (and including) 2000 underwriting years covering any adverse development on reserves calculated as of December 31, 2003 between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2005. The treaty has alimit of $500 million and will limit future loss development at XLRA relating to these underwriting years. Any commutation of this treaty requires the prior approval of the New York Department of Insurance. There is no impact of this treaty onthe consolidated financial statements of the Company; however as part of management's continuing evaluation of its deferred tax asset, the treaty is critical in evaluating the future income position of the U.S. group of companies. Managementbelieves that the treaty will protect the U.S. group from unexpected prior loss development. Absent unexpected loss development from the 2000 and prior underwriting years, management has concluded that there is sufficient positive evidence of futureprofitability in the U.S. and that a valuation allowance as a charge against the deferred tax asset is not required at this time.

     Shareholders' equity at December 31, 2005 and 2004 reflected tax benefits of $1.8 million and $3.6 million, respectively, related to compensation expense deductions for stockoptions exercised by the Company's U.S. subsidiaries.

(1) Required statutory capital and surplus represents 100% RBC level for principle U.S. operating subsidiaries.

     The difference between statutory financial statements and statements prepared in accordance with GAAP vary by jurisdiction however the primary difference is that statutory financial statementsdo not reflect deferred policy acquisition costs, deferred income tax net assets, intangible assets, unrealized appreciation on investments and any unauthorized/authorized reinsurance charges.

     Except as noted below, there are no statutory restrictions on the payment of dividends from retained earnings by any of the Company's subsidiaries as applicable minimum levels of solvencyand liquidity have been met and all regulatory requirements and licensing rules complied with. At December 31, 2005, and 2004 (XLRA), the Company's lead property and casualty subsidiary in the United States, had a statutory deficit of $3.6million and $84.4 million, respectively. As a result, XLRA cannot declare or distribute any dividends to shareholders during any twelve month period that exceeds the lesser of 10% of surplus of 100% of net investment income, without obtainingprior approval of the New York Insurance Department. Similarly, three of the seven property and casualty subsidiaries directly or indirectly owned by XLRA also had statutory deficits ranging from $13.2 million to $46.9 million at December31, 2005 and four of the seven had statutory deficits ranging from $0.2 million to $57.4 million at December 31, 2004. As a result, these subsidiaries are similarly unable to currently make a dividend distribution under the insurance law oftheir respective states of domicile without obtaining prior approval from the domicile insurance department, which include Delaware, New York and North Dakota. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, XL Insurance Company Limited (previously known asWinterthur International Insurance Company Limited) had a statutory earned deficit and is restricted from making a dividend distribution at this time under U.K. Company law.

  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm


To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of XL Capital Ltd:


     We have completed integrated audits of XL Capital Ltd's 2005 and 2004 consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, and anaudit of its 2003 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.

     Consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules


     In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 8, present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of XL Capital Ltd and itssubsidiaries at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United Statesof America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedules listed in the index appearing under Item 15 (2) present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the relatedconsolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financialstatement schedules based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit toobtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Internal control over financial reporting

     Also, in our opinion, management's assessment, included in Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the Company maintainedeffective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairlystated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established inInternal Control - Integrated Framework issued by COSO. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financialreporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on management's assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control overfinancial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal controlover financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment,testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

     A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation offinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of recordsthat, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assur-

192


ance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being madeonly in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets thatcould have a material effect on the financial statements. 

     Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periodsare subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm


To the Board of Directors and Shareholder of XL Capital Assurance Inc. and Subsidiary: 

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), of changes in shareholder's equity and of cash flows present fairly, in allmaterial respects, the financial position of XL Capital Assurance Inc. and its subsidiary (the “Company”), at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the periodended December 31, 2005 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion onthese financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
 
(UnitedStates). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting theamounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonablebasis for our opinion.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

	1.

      	
	Organization and Ownership

	

 

 
XL Capital Assurance Inc. (“XLCA”) is a wholly owned subsidiary of XL Reinsurance America, Inc. (“XL RE AM”). XL RE AM and XLCA are indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of XL Capital Ltd (“XLCapital”), a public company whose shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange.


 

 
XLCA is an insurance company domiciled in the State of New York and is licensed to conduct financial guaranty insurance business throughout all 50 of the United States, as well as in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, theDistrict of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Singapore. In addition, XLCA through its wholly owned subsidiary, XL Capital Assurance (U.K.) Limited, (“XLCA-UK”), is licensed to conduct financial guaranty business in the UnitedKingdom. In addition, XLCA-UK is permitted to conduct business in Ireland, Spain, France, Portugal, Italy, The Netherlands, Greece, and Germany (XLCA and XLCA-UK are hereafter collectively referred to as the “Company”). XLCA and XLCA-UKhave triple-A financial strength ratings from Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, Moody's Investors Service, Inc., and Fitch Inc. The Company is primarily engaged in the business of providing credit enhancement on fixed and variablerate income securities through the issuance of financial guaranty insurance policies, and credit protection on specific referenced credits or on pools of specific referenced credits through the issuance of credit default swaps. To facilitatedistribution of their products XLCA maintains a branch office abroad in Singapore and XLCA-UK maintains a branch office in Madrid. In addition, XLCA has an office in California.


 

 
Financial guaranty insurance provides an unconditional and irrevocable guaranty to the holder of a debt obligation of full and timely payment of principal and interest when due. In the event of a default under theobligation, the insurer has recourse against the issuer and/or any related collateral (which is more common in the case of insured asset-backed obligations or other non-municipal debt) for amounts paid under the terms of the policy. Credit defaultswaps are derivative contracts which offer credit protection relating to a particular security or pools of specified securities. Under the terms of a credit default swap, the seller of credit protection makes a specified payment to the buyer ofcredit protection upon the occurrence of one or more specified credit events with respect to a referenced security. Credit derivatives typically provide protection to a buyer rather than credit enhancement of an issue as in traditional financialguaranty insurance. The Company's underwriting policies limit the Company to providing credit protection on obligations or referenced securities that it determines would be of investment-grade quality without the benefit of credit enhancementprovided by the Company through the issuance of insurance policies and credit default swaps. See Notes 9 and 15 for further details.

	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

	

 

 
Basis of Presentation and Consolidation

	

 

 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of XLCA and XLCA- UK and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America(“GAAP”), which for insurance companies differ in certain respects from the accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the New York Insurance Department (“NYID”) (See Note 14). All significant inter-company accounts andtransactions have been eliminated. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assetsand liabilities, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses.

    results may differ from those          estimates. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform          with the current year's presentation. 

       Investments 


       All of the Company's investments in          fixed maturity securities are considered available-for-sale and accordingly          are carried at fair value. The fair value of investments is based on          quoted market prices received from a nationally recognized pricing          service or dealer quotes. The net unrealized appreciation or depreciation          on investments, net of deferred federal income tax, is included in          accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Any unrealized depreciation          in value considered by management to be other than temporary is charged          to income in the period that such determination is made.

       At the end of each accounting period, the          Company reviews unrealized losses on its investment securities to identify          declines in fair value that are other than temporary. This review involves          consideration of several factors including (i) the time period during          which the security has been in a continuous unrealized loss position,          (ii) an analysis of the liquidity, business prospects and overall financial          condition of the issuer, (iii) the significance of the decline, (iv)          an analysis of the collateral structure and other credit support, as          applicable, of the securities in question and (v) the Company's          intent and ability to hold the investment for a sufficient period of          time for the value to recover. Where the Company concludes that a decline          in fair value is other than temporary, the cost of the security is          written down to fair value and a corresponding loss is realized in          the period such determination is made.

       With respect to securities where the decline          in value is determined to be temporary and the security's value          is not written down, a subsequent decision may be made to sell that          security and realize a loss. Subsequent decisions on security sales          are made within the context of overall risk monitoring, changing information,          general market conditions and assessing value relative to other comparable          securities. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, there          were no declines in fair value deemed to be other than temporary.

       Bond discounts and premiums are amortized          on the effective yield method over the remaining terms of securities          acquired. For mortgage-backed securities, and any other holdings for          which prepayment risk may be significant, assumptions regarding prepayments          are evaluated periodically and revised as necessary. Any adjustments          required due to the resulting change in effective yields are recognized          in income. 

       Short-term investments comprise securities          with maturities equal to or greater than 90 days but less than one          year at time of purchase. Cash equivalents include fixed interest and          money market fund deposits with a maturity of less than 90 days when          purchased. 

       All investment transactions are recorded          on a trade date basis. Realized gains and losses on sales of fixed          maturity securities are determined on the basis of specific identification.          Investment income is recognized when earned. 

      Other Invested Assets 


       Other invested assets consist of certain          notes acquired in connection with the satisfaction of a claim in connection          with the default of an insured obligation 
- 
see Note 10 (b). Income on such notes is recognized based on the          effective yield method. Under the effective yield method, the excess          of all cash flows expected from the notes at acquisition over the Company's          initial investment in the notes is recognized as interest income on          a level-yield basis over the expected life of the notes. Subsequent          increases in cash flows expected to be collected are recognized prospectively          through adjustment of the notes' yield over its expected remaining          life. Decreases in cash flows expected to be collected will be recognized          as impairments and will be reflected in the accompanying consolidated          statement of operations under the caption “Net realized losses          on investments.”

      Premium Revenue Recognition 


       Upfront premiums are reported as written          and earned in proportion to the expiration of the related risk. The          amount of risk outstanding is equal to the sum of the par amounts of          debt insured. Upfront premiums are apportioned to individual sinking          fund payments of a bond issue according to its amortization schedule.    After the premiums are allocated to each scheduled sinking fund

    payment, they are earned on a straight-line          basis over the period of that sinking fund payment. Accordingly, deferred          premium revenue represents the portion of premiums written that is          applicable to the unexpired risk of insured bonds and notes. Installment          premiums are reported as written when due and are earned over each          installment period, generally a month or quarter. 

       When an insured issue is retired early, is          called by the issuer, or is in substance paid in advance through a          refunding accomplished by placing U.S. Government securities in escrow,          the remaining deferred premium revenue is earned at that time since          there is no longer risk to the Company. Premiums ceded to reinsurers          reduce the amount of earned premium the Company will recognize from          its insurance policies. For both upfront and installment policies,          ceded premium expense is recognized in earnings in proportion to and          at the same time the related premium revenue is recognized. Ceding          commission income is recognized in earnings at the time the related          premium is recognized. 

       Fee Income and Other 


       The Company collects advisory and structuring          fees in connection with certain transactions. Depending upon the type          of fee received, the fee is either earned when services are rendered          or the fee is due or deferred and earned over the life of the related          transaction. Termination fees are earned when due and are included          in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations under the          caption “Fee Income and Other”. Structuring, waiver and consent          fees, and commitment fees are included in the accompanying consolidated          statements of operations as premiums and earned on a straight-line          basis over the life of the related transaction.

      Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses

       The financial guaranties issued by the Company          insure scheduled payments of principal and interest due on various          types of financial obligations against default by the issuers of such          obligations. Reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses are established          by the Company's management based on recommendations from its          Loss Reserve Committee, which is comprised of members of senior management.          Establishment of such reserves requires the use of judgment and estimates          with respect to the occurrence and amount of a loss on an insured obligation.          Reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses in the accompanying          consolidated balance sheets are reflected before the effect of reinsurance.

       The Company establishes two types of reserves          for losses and loss adjustment expenses for non-derivative financial          guaranties: case basis reserves and unallocated reserves. Case basis          reserves are established with respect to a specific insurance policy          upon receipt of a claim notice or when management determines that (i)          a claim is probable in the future with respect to the policy based          on specific credit events that have occurred and (ii) the amount of          the ultimate loss that the Company will incur under such policy can          be reasonably estimated. The amount of the case basis reserve with          respect to any policy is based on the net present value of the expected          ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense payments that the Company          expects to make with respect to such policy, net of expected recoveries          under salvage and subrogation rights. Case basis reserves are discounted          based on a discount rate equal to the actual yield of the Company's          fixed income portfolio at the end of the preceding fiscal quarter.          The Company believes this yield is an appropriate rate to present value          its reserves because it reflects the rate of return on the assets supporting          future claim payments by the Company. When a case basis reserve is          established for an insured obligation whose premium is paid on an upfront          basis, the Company continues to record premium earnings on such policy          over its remaining life, unless the Company has recorded a full limit    loss with respect to such policy, in

    which case, the remaining unearned premium          relating thereto is immediately reflected in earnings. With respect          to installment premium business, case basis reserves are reduced by          the future amount of installment premium expected to be collected.

       A number of variables are considered when          establishing a case basis reserves on an individual policy. These variables          include the creditworthiness of the underlying issuer of the insured          obligation, whether the obligation is secured or unsecured, the projected          cash flow or market value of any assets that collateralize or secure          the insured obligation and, the historical and projected loss rates          on such assets. Other factors that may affect the actual ultimate loss          on a policy include the state of the economy, changes in interest rates,          rates of inflation and the salvage values of specific collateral. The          methodology used by the Company for determining when a case basis reserve          is established may differ from other financial guaranty insurance          companies, as well as from other property and casualty insurance enterprises.

       In addition to case basis reserves, the Company          maintains an unallocated loss reserve for expected losses associated          with currently insured issues, which is estimated by management based          upon an actuarial reserving analysis. The actuarial methodology applied          by the Company is in accordance with Actuarial Standards of Practice          No. 36, 
Determination of Reasonable          Provision

. The methodology applied          is based on the selection of an initial expected loss ratio, as well          as an expected loss emergence pattern (or the expected pattern of the          expiration of risk on in force policies). In accordance with the Company's          accounting policy, the unallocated reserve is increased each quarter          by applying the initial expected loss ratio to earned premium for the          period and adjusted each quarter to reflect the expected loss emergence          pattern (or the expected pattern of the expiration of risk on in force          policies). The expected loss emergence pattern is analyzed on an annual          basis as part of the Company's review of the overall adequacy          of the unallocated loss reserve. 

       The Company's selection of an initial          expected loss ratio and loss emergence pattern considers the characteristics          of the Company's in force business, as well its actual loss experience          and that of the industry. On an annual basis, the Company compares          its selected initial expected loss ratio to its actual loss experience,          as well as to industry loss experience, and will adjust it as considered          necessary, to ensure such initial expected loss ratio continues to          be appropriate for the risks in its in-force business. In addition,          the expected loss emergence pattern will be adjusted or realigned on          an annual basis, as considered necessary, to better correlate with          the underlying changes in the Company's in force business (e.g.,           changes in the average life of in-force business resulting from changes          in the mix of business and risk expiration).

       The Company's unallocated loss reserve          is established on an undiscounted basis. The Company's unallocated          loss reserve represents management's best estimate of losses will          be incurred as a result of credit deterioration in the Company's          insured portfolio but which have not yet been specifically identified.

       Management believes that the Company's          reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses are adequate to cover          the Company's ultimate net cost of claims. However, because the          reserves are based on management's judgment and estimates, there          can be no assurance that the ultimate liability will not exceed such          estimates. See Note 10 for additional information regarding the Company's    reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses.

December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 

       
     
  
       
    The Company's loss reserving policy,          described above, is based on guidance provided in SFAS 60, 
“Accounting and Reporting by Insurance            Enterprises,”

 SFAS 5, 
“Accounting            for Contingencies” 

and analogies to Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 85-20, 
“Recognition            of Fees for Guaranteeing a Loan.”

 SFAS            60 requires that, for short-duration contracts, a liability for unpaid            claim costs relating to insurance contracts, including estimates            of costs relating to incurred but not reported claims, be accrued            when insured events occur. Additionally, SFAS 5 requires that a loss            be recognized where it is probable that one or more future events            will occur confirming that a liability has been incurred at the date            of the financial statements and the amount of loss can be reasonably            estimated.

       Although SFAS 60 provides guidance to insurance          enterprises, the Company does not believe SFAS 60 comprehensively addresses          the unique attributes of financial guaranty insurance contracts, as          the standard was developed prior to the maturity of the financial guaranty          industry. SFAS 60 provides guidance with respect to insurance contracts          that are either short-duration or long-duration in nature. Financial          guaranty contracts typically have attributes of both and, therefore,          are difficult to classify as either. For instance, financial guaranty          contracts are reported for regulatory purposes as property and liability          insurance, normally considered short-duration, but have elements of          long-duration contracts in that they are irrevocable and extend over          a period that may be in excess of 30 years.

       The Company believes its loss reserving policy          reflects the requirements of applicable accounting literature, as well          as the fact that financial guaranty losses occur over time as a result          of credit deterioration, operational difficulties of the insured obligor          or fraud, which may not be specifically detected when they occur but          which can be generally estimated across a portfolio of insured obligations          based on the credit quality and nature of the portfolio and historical          default data. The Company does, however, recognize premium revenue          and policy acquisition costs in a manner consistent with the guidance          provided in SFAS 60 for short-duration contracts. If the Company was          required to classify its insurance contracts as either short-duration          or long-duration or if new specific guidance for financial guaranty          insurance emerges, different methods of accounting could apply with          respect to loss reserving and liability recognition, and possibly extend          to premium revenue and policy acquisition cost recognition. Additionally,          there are differences in the methodology and measurement of loss reserves          followed by other financial guaranty companies.

       In June 2005, at the request of the Securities          and Exchange Commission, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)          added a project to their agenda to review and provide guidance for          the accounting for financial guaranty insurance contracts under which          it will consider claims liability recognition, premium recognition,          and the related amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs.          The Company will continue to apply the accounting policies noted herein          until further guidance is provided by the FASB.

       Deferred Acquisition Costs 


       Policy acquisition costs include those expenses          that primarily relate to, and vary with, the production of new business.          The Company periodically conducts a study to determine which operating          costs constitute acquisition costs and qualify for deferral. These          costs include direct and indirect expenses related to underwriting,          marketing and policy issuance, rating agency fees and premium taxes,          and are reduced by ceding commission income on premiums ceded to reinsurers.          Policy acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the period    in which the related premiums are earned.

    The Company will recognize a premium deficiency          if the sum of expected losses and loss adjustment expenses, maintenance          costs and unamortized policy acquisition costs exceed the related unearned          premiums and the present value of future premiums under installment          contracts written. If the Company was to have a premium deficiency          that is greater than unamortized acquisition costs, the unamortized          acquisition costs would be reduced by a charge to expense, and a liability          (if necessary) would be established for any remaining deficiency. For          the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, there have been          no premium deficiencies. Although GAAP permits the inclusion of anticipated          investment income when determining a premium deficiency, it is currently          not being included in the Company's evaluation.
 


       If an insured issue is retired or defeased          prior to the end of the expected period of coverage, the remaining          net amount of deferred acquisition costs and deferred ceding commissions          with respect to such insured issue is recognized at such time. 

       Reinsurance 


       In the normal course of business, the Company          seeks to reduce the loss that may arise from events that could cause          unfavorable underwriting results by reinsuring certain levels of risk          in various areas of exposure with other insurance enterprises or reinsurers.          Reinsurance premiums ceded are earned on a pro-rata basis over the          period the reinsurance coverage is provided. Prepaid reinsurance premiums          represent the portion of premiums ceded which is applicable to the          unexpired term of policies in-force. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers          are estimated in a manner consistent with the claim liability associated          with the reinsured policy. Provision is made for any estimated uncollectible          reinsurance.

       Intangible Assets - Acquired Licenses 


       XLCA's licenses to conduct financial          guaranty insurance business in 45 states of the United States were          acquired as part of its acquisition of The London Assurance of America,          Inc. (“LAA”) in 2001. Under SFAS 142, the recoverability          of the carrying value of these intangible assets are evaluated annually          for impairment based on a review of forecasted discounted cash flows          and by referencing other available information. As of December 31,          2005 and 2004, there were no adjustments to the carrying value of intangible          assets resulting from these evaluations. 

       Income Taxes 


                 The Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for          income taxes. Deferred Federal income taxes are provided for temporary          differences between the tax and financial reporting basis of assets          and liabilities that will result in deductible or taxable amounts in          future years when the reported amounts of the assets or liabilities          are recovered or settled. A valuation allowance against deferred tax          assets is recorded if it is more likely than not that all, or some          portion, of the benefits related to deferred tax assets will not be          realized.

       Derivative Instruments - Credit Default            Swaps 


       The Company recognizes all derivatives as          either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and          measures those instruments at fair value. Derivative instruments that          the Company holds consist of credit default swaps issued by the Company          which meet the definition of a derivative under FASB Statement of Accounting          Standards No. 133, “
Accounting          for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities as amended” 

(“SFAS          133”) by FASB Statement of Accounting Standards No. 149. The Company          intends to hold these derivative instruments until maturity. The Company          does not hold any derivatives that are designated as hedges for financial          reporting purposes. 

       The fair value of credit default swaps is          determined using a model developed by the Company and is dependent          upon a number of factors including changes in interest rates, credit          spreads, changes in credit quality, expected recovery rates and other    market factors. The change resulting from

December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 

       
     
  
       
    movements in these factors is unrealized          as the credit default swaps are not traded to realize this value. Other          elements of the change in fair value are based upon pricing established          at the inception of the contract, as well as events triggering loss          payments under the contracts by the Company.

       Effective January 1, 2005, the Company changed          the presentation of the results from credit default swaps in its statement          of operations to reclassify changes in the fair value of such instruments          attributable to earnings from revenue received by the Company from          the issuance of such contracts and losses from actual and expected          payments to counterparties under such contracts from the line item          caption entitled “net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on          credit derivatives” to the “premium” and “losses          and loss adjustment expense” captions in the statement, respectively.          In addition, certain reclassifications were made to the Company's          balance sheet to correspond with the aforementioned changes in its          statement of operations. This change in presentation is applicable          only to credit default swaps issued by the Company that it has the          intent and ability to hold to maturity and is consistent with practices          in the financial guaranty insurance industry for reporting the results          of such instruments. Results of prior periods presented have been reclassified          to conform to the current period presentation. 

       Variable Interest Entities 


       In the ordinary course of the Company's          business the company participates in transactions which utilize variable          interest entities (“VIE's”). The Company provides financial          guaranty insurance of structured transactions backed by pools of assets          of specified types, municipal obligations supported by the issuers' ability          to charge fees for specified services or projects, and corporate risk          obligations including essential infrastructure projects and obligations          backed by receivables from future sales of commodities and other specified          services. The obligations related to these transactions are often securitized          through off-balance sheet VIE's. In synthetic transactions, the          Company guarantees payment obligations of counterparties, including          VIE's, through credit default swaps referencing asset portfolios.          The Company only provides financial guaranty insurance of these VIE's          for premiums at market rates but does not hold any equity positions          or subordinated debt in these off-balance sheet arrangements. These          financial guaranty insurance contracts represent variable interests          held by the Company in VIE's.

       In underwriting financial guaranty insurance,          the Company believes the risk of any loss to be remote based upon the          Company's requirement that guaranteed obligations be investment-grade          prior to the provision of credit enhancement. Typically, in the case          of asset-backed securities and other structured obligations, such investment          grade ratings are based upon subordination, cash reserves and other          structural protections. Consequently, the Company has determined that          it is not the primary beneficiary of any VIE's in which it holds          a variable interest. Accordingly, these VIE's are not consolidated.          Disclosures of the Company's exposure to loss and nature and size          of VIE's in which the Company is involved are included in Note          9. 

       Recent Accounting Pronouncements 


       In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff          Position (“FSP”) FIN 46(R)-5, 
Implicit          Variable Interests Under FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) 

(“FSP FIN 46(R)-5”), which requires an enterprise to consider          whether it holds an implicit variable interest in a Variable Interest          Entity (“VIE”) and what effect this may have on the calculation          of expected losses and residual returns of the VIE and the determination          of which party, if any, is considered the primary beneficiary of the          VIE. FSP FIN 46(R)-5 is effective for the first reporting period beginning          after March 3, 2005 and did not have a material impact on the Company's    financial condition or results of operations.

	In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 115-1, 
The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments 

to finalizethe guidance which was initially provided in EITF 03-1, on (1) when an investment is considered impaired, (2) whether that impairment is "other-than-temporary," (3) how to measure the impairment loss, and (4) disclosures related to impairedsecurities. This FSP nullifies EITF 03-1's guidance on determining whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, and effectively retains the previous guidance in this area. The FSP generally carries forward EITF 03-1's guidance for determining whenan investment is impaired, how to measure the impairment loss, and what disclosures should be made regarding impaired securities.

    The Company has gross unrealized losses which it considers to be temporary impairments. Individual security positions comprising this balance have been evaluated by management, based on specific criteria, to determine if these impairments should be considered other than temporary. These criteria include an assessment of the severity and length of time securities have been impaired, along with management's ability and intent to hold the securities to recovery, among other factors. 

  
       
     
  
       
     The following tables present the Company's        investments' gross unrealized losses and fair value, aggregated        by investment category and length of time that individual securities    have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively:

	Reinsurance

	

 

 
	The Company utilizes reinsurance principally to increase its capacity to write business and for risk management purposes. This reinsurance includes the reinsurance arrangements with affiliates that are discussed in Note 4,as well as other reinsurance arrangements with non-affiliated reinsures. Reinsurance does not relieve the Company of its obligations under its policies of insurance and credit default swap contracts. Accordingly, the Company is still liable undersuch policies and contracts even if any or all of the reinsuring companies are unable to meet their obligations to the Company, or contest such obligations. The Company regularly monitors the financial condition of its reinsures. For the years endedDecember 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 no reinsurance recoverable were determined to be uncollectible. The following tables set forth certain amounts ceded to affiliate and non-affiliate reinsures as of and for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and2003. The affiliated amounts presented for 2004 do not include the effect of the commutation with XL RE AM discussed in Note 4.

     Outstanding Exposure and Collateral

  
  
       
     
  
       
    Financial guaranty insurance policies issued          by the Company guaranty the timely payment of principal and interest          on insured obligations. Credit default swaps issued by the Company          guaranty the payment of the notional amounts of referenced securities.          The net exposure retained on any risk guaranteed by the Company is          subject to the Company's underwriting guidelines and regulatory          risk limitations. The Company's in force business is diversified          both domestically and internationally, across multiple industries and          by type of obligations guaranteed. The Company's total exposure,          before reinsurance, to principal (or “par”) amounts insured          and notional amounts guaranteed as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $83.3          billion and $66.0 billion, respectively. The Company's total          exposure, before reinsurance, to principal and interest amounts insured          and notional amounts guaranteed as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $122.3          billion and $95.6 billion, respectively.

       The following tables present certain information          with respect to the par amounts insured and notional amount guaranteed by the Company at December          31, 2005 and 2004, before and after reinsurance (or on a “gross” and “net” basis,          respectively):

    The Company limits its exposure to losses          from writing financial guarantees through its credit approval process          and by maintaining a surveillance function which monitors insured/guaranteed transactions.          In addition, the Company's underwriting policies limit the Company          to providing credit protection on obligations or referenced securities          that it determines would be of investment-grade quality without the          benefit of credit enhancement provided by the Company through the issuance          of insurance policies and credit default swaps. Also, risk of loss          is mitigated by the Company by diversifying its portfolio and maintaining          rigorous collateral requirements on asset-backed obligations, as well          as through reinsurance. 

       As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the gross          and net par amounts of insured and guaranteed obligations in the asset-backed insured    and guaranteed portfolio are backed by the following types of collateral:

    In its asset-backed business, the Company          considers geographic concentration as a factor in its underwriting          process. However, the existence of first-loss protection in a typical          asset-backed securitization, in addition to other factors, makes it          difficult to attribute geographic exposure to deals collateralized          by diversified pools of obligations. For asset-backed transactions,          the Company considers the seller/servicer, industry, and type of collateral          to be more relevant measures of diversification. 

       Set forth below is the Company's par          exposure from the issuance of financial guaranty insurance policies          and its notional exposure from the issuance of credit default swaps    as of December 31, 2005 and 2004:

    Case Basis Reserves for Losses and Loss            Adjustment Expenses 


       Set forth below is a discussion of certain    case basis reserves established by the Company: 


  
       
     
     
  
       
         a.


     During the year ended December 31, 2004, the        Company recorded a provision for losses of approximately $42.1 million,        representing the present value loss expected to be incurred in the future        with respect to an insured project financing. Because this loss represented        a full limit loss to the subordinated tranche of the insured transaction,        the remaining unearned premium pertaining to such tranche, which aggregated        approximately $23.3 million, was fully earned resulting in a net        loss, before reinsurance, of approximately $18.8 million. The portion        of the insured exposure to which this loss relates was fully reinsured        on a first-loss basis by an affiliate of the Company and, accordingly,        there was no net impact on the Company's results of operations from        this loss provision. Pursuant to the assumptions upon which the estimate        was based, under its existing reinsurance arrangements, approximately        17.5% of any additional loss provision in excess of the aforementioned        amount provided will be retained by the Company. During 2005, the Company        recorded an additional provision for loss relating to this transaction        of $16.7 million ($2.8 million after reinsurance to affiliates),        on a net present value basis, to reflect certain adverse developments.        The total remaining par insured by the Company in connection with this        transaction (net of applicable carried case reserves), which amortizes        over the next 13 years, aggregated approximately $237.8        million ($43.1 million net of reinsurance to affiliates) at December        31, 2005. The estimate of loss was based on assumptions and        estimates extending over many years into the future. There is currently        no payment default with respect to this transaction. Management continues        to monitor the exposure and will revise its loss estimate if necessary        as new information becomes available.
 
  
       
        

     
  
       
         b.


     In December 2005 certain notes which were        insured by the Company and collateralized by loans to medical providers        (the “Insured Notes”) defaulted upon their maturity. In satisfaction        of the resulting claim, the Company purchased the Insured Notes for $20.2        million, which represented the remaining outstanding principal and accrued        interest on the Insured Notes. The Insured Notes were recorded as an        investment at their estimated fair value of $19.5 million at the        date of acquisition and are reflected in the accompanying consolidated        balance sheet under the caption, “Other invested assets”. The        difference between the estimated fair value of the Insured Notes at the        date they were acquired and the consideration paid to acquire the notes        was recorded as a paid loss of $0.7 million ($0.1 million, net        of reinsurance to XLFA - see Note 4). At December 31, 2005, the Company        had a receivable from XLFA in the amount of $7.7 million with respect        to the remaining amount uncollected for the Insured Notes, as well as        a “Funds        held” liability to XLFA in the amount of $15.9 million. The funds held        liability accrues interest at the same rate of the Insured Notes. See        Note 2 - Other    Invested Assets.

	          c.


	 Subsequent event: The estimate of fair value of the	    Insured Notes was based on the Company's estimate of the fair value	    of the underlying collateral which, as previously discussed, consisted of	    loans to medical providers. Certain of these loans were made to Intrepid	    USA Healthcare Services (“Intrepid”), a national provider of home	    nursing services to patients with acute illnesses. Intrepid declared bankruptcy	    in 2004. On February 3, 2006, Intrepid emerged from bankruptcy. In connection	    therewith, in February 2006, the Company accepted preferred stock of Intrepid	    in exchange for the cancellation of a portion of the Insured Notes. This	    preferred stock is in-substance common stock, as defined in EITF 02-14, 
Whether	    an Investor Should Apply the Equity Method of Accounting to Investments	    Other Than Common Stock, 

and represents	    a 49% ownership interest in Intrepid. In connection with, and critical to,	    Intrepid's emergence from bankruptcy was certain exit financing obtained	    by Intrepid. Pursuant to the terms of the related credit agreement, Intrepid	    must achieve certain financial targets over certain periods of time. In	    certain cases, if such targets are not met, the provider of such financing	    may foreclose on all ownership interest in Intrepid. If the provider of	    the financing foreclosed on all ownership interest in Intrepid,     which is not expected by management, the Company would	    be required to write-off the carrying value of this investment, which was	    approximately $13.5 million at December 31, 2005. Any loss associated	    with this write-off will be subject to the reinsurance arrangement with    XLFA described above.

	              d.
    

	      During the year ended December     31, 2005, the Company recorded a provision for loss of $5.2 million     ($0.9 million, net of reinsurance to XLFA - see Note 4) representing     the present value loss expected to be incurred in the future with respect     to an insured residential mortgage securitization. The total insured     exposure to which this loss relates was 82.6% reinsured by an affiliate of     the Company on a pro rata basis. The total remaining par insured by the     Company in connection with this transaction aggregated approximately     $264.2 million ($39.7 million net of reinsurance to XLFA) at     December 31, 2005, and amortizes over many years into the future. The     estimate of loss was based on assumptions and estimates     extending over many years into the future. There is currently no payment     default with respect to this transaction. Management continues to monitor     the exposure and will revise its loss estimate if necessary, as new information     becomes available.
 


 


       
    In addition to the matters discussed above,          at December 31, 2005 the Company had case basis loss adjustment expense          reserves of $ 2.1 million, which primarily relate to remediation          efforts associated with the aforementioned transactions.

       The financing vehicles through which the          insured exposures referred to above were issued are variable interest          entities, as defined under FASB Interpretation 46/46R, 
Consolidation          of Variable Interest Entities

,          however, the Company is not the primary beneficiary of such entities.          If the transactions are restructured or if the Company exercises its          contractual rights under such transactions in the event of a default,          the primary beneficiary in such transactions will have to be reconsidered.          If such events occur, the Company may be required to consolidate the          financing vehicles. 

      Unallocated Reserves 

       In accordance with the Company's accounting          policy discussed in Note 2, the Company's net provision for unallocated          reserves is a function of applying the initial expected loss ratio          to earned premium each period and the expected loss emergence pattern.          For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, the Company          recorded a net provision for unallocated reserves of $1.6 million, $2.0    million, and $1.4 million, respectively. 


  
       
     
  
      11.




    Income Taxes


  
       
     
  
       
    The Company's Federal income tax return          is consolidated with XLA and its subsidiaries (the “Consolidated          Group”). XLA maintains a tax sharing agreement with its subsidiaries,          whereby the consolidated tax liability is allocated among affiliates          in the ratio that each affiliate's separate return liability bears          to the sum of the separate return liabilities of all affiliates that          are members of the Consolidated Group. In addition, a complementary          method is used which results in reimbursement by profitable affiliates          to loss affiliates for tax benefits generated by loss affiliates. At          December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had a Federal income tax payable          of $1,023,000 and $2,917,000 to XLA, respectively. 

       The U.S. Federal income tax rate applicable          to ordinary income is 35%. The actual tax expense on income from operations    differs from the “expected” amount for the following reasons:

    During 2005 the Company established a valuation          allowance with respect to its deferred tax assets of $888,000,          which was the balance of such allowance at December 31, 2005. This          valuation allowance relates to net unrealized capital losses and a net          realized capital loss carry forward that may not be realized within a          reasonable period. At December 31, 2005, the XLCA has net unrealized          capital losses and a net realized capital loss carry forward of          approximately $2.3 million and $242,000 respectively, against          which the valuation allowance was established in 2005. The net          realized capital loss carry forward will expire in 2010. 

       Management believes it is more likely than          not that the tax benefit relating to the Company's deferred tax    assets, net of the valuation allowance discussed above, will be realized.

    Deferred premium revenue, net of prepaid            reinsurance premiums:

 The carrying            amount of deferred premium revenue, net of prepaid reinsurance premiums,            represents the Company's future premium revenue, net of reinsurance,            on policies where the premium was received at the inception of the            insurance contract. The fair value of deferred premium revenue, net            of prepaid reinsurance premiums, is an estimate of the premiums that            would be paid under a reinsurance agreement with a third party to            transfer the Company's financial guaranty risk, net of that            portion of the premiums retained by the Company to compensate it            for originating and servicing the insurance contract. 

       Losses and loss expenses, net of reinsurance            balances recoverable:

 The carrying            value is assumed to be fair value, because the provision is established            for non-specific expected levels of losses resulting from credit            failures. 

       Installment premiums:

 The          fair value of installment premiums is estimated based on the present          value of the future contractual premium revenues, net of reinsurance,          that would be paid under a reinsurance agreement with a third party          to transfer the Company's financial guaranty risk, net of that          portion of the premium retained by the Company to compensate it for          originating and servicing the insurance contract. The fair value is          derived by calculating the present value of the estimated future cash          flow stream (net premium and ceding commissions) discounted at 4.87%    and 3.61% at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

    The principal differences result from the following    statutory accounting practices:

  
       
     
  
       
    •
    Bonds are carried at amortized cost rather        than designated as available for sale and carried at
 market        value. Unrealized gains or losses are not recognized as a separate component        of
 shareholder's equity net of    applicable deferred Federal income taxes.

  
       
     
     
  
       
    •
    A formula-based contingency reserve is established by an appropriation	of unassigned surplus. This reserve is calculated at the greater of a prescribed percentage applied to insured	outstanding principal or 50% of premiums written, net of ceded reinsurance. The prescribed percentage varies	by the type of outstanding principal. The reserve is available to be applied to new case bias reserves that are	established for claims on current outstanding insured principal and interest in the future. An unallocated reserve	is not recorded.

  
       
     
     
  
       
    •
    Current Federal income taxes are provided only        on taxable income for which income taxes are
 currently        payable and deferred tax assets are limited to an amount determined to        be realizable
 within one year based        on management's estimation of the future realizability of deferred    tax
 assets.

  
       
     
     
  
       
    •
    Under GAAP certain subsidiaries are required        to be consolidated, whereas under SAP such
 subsidiaries    are accounted for under statutory equity method accounting principles.

    •
    Acquisition costs are charged to operations as incurred rather than as related premiums are earned.

  
       
     
     
  
       
    •
    Upfront premiums are recognized as earned when    the related risk has expired rather than over the period of risk.

  
       
     
     
  
       
    •
     Certain assets designated as “non-admitted        assets” are charged directly to statutory surplus, but are reflected    as assets under GAAP.
 
  
       
     
  
       
    Under New York Insurance Law, the        Company may pay dividends to XL RE AM, without the prior approval of        the Superintendent of the NYID, only from earned statutory policyholders' surplus        subject to the maintenance of the minimum capital and surplus requirement.        In addition, the dividend, together with all other dividends declared        or distributed by the Company during the preceding twelve months, may        not exceed the lesser of 10% of its policyholders' surplus as shown        in the Company's last filed statement, or adjusted net investment        income, as defined, for such twelve-month period. As of December 31,        2005 the Company had no earned surplus available for the payment of dividends    during the next twelve months.

    Credit Default Swaps


  
       
     
  
       
    Credit default swaps insured          by the Company meet the definition of a derivative under SFAS No. 133.          The Company has recorded these products at fair value, modeled on prevailing          market conditions and certain other factors relating to the structure          and credit quality of the transaction. The Company considers credit          default swaps to be, in substance, financial guaranty contracts as          the Company intends to hold them to maturity. See Note 2 for information regarding the Company's accounting policy for credit default swaps. 

       Credit default swaps generally cover a portfolio          of securities. The credit ratings of the underlying securities vary          and a single rating is calculated for the Company's exposure at          the inception of the transaction by an independent credit rating agency.          In order to effectively price and market the transaction, different          tranches are modeled for the purpose of assigning credit ratings based          upon the level of subordination. Generally, a primary layer of first          loss protection is created with the Company participating in the senior          or higher quality rated tranches of the transaction. 

       The Company's exposure is fair valued          taking into account changes in credit spreads, current market conditions,          as well as the overall credit quality of the underlying collateral. 

       The Company's credit default swap portfolio          generally requires the Company to meet payment obligations for referenced          credits within the portfolio in the event of specific credit events          after exhaustion of various first loss protection levels. These credit          events are contract-specific, but generally cover bankruptcy and failure          to pay. The credit default swap portfolio consists of structured pools          of corporate obligations and asset backed securities that have investment-grade          ratings at the deals' inception. On a net par basis, at December          31, 2005 approximately 95.4% of the portfolio is rated AAA with the          remaining 4.6% allocated to other investment-grade ratings. The weighted          average term of the contracts in force was 4.93 years. The components          of the Company's net credit default swap asset and liability classified          with other assets and accounts payable and accrued expenses, respectively,    at December 31, 2005 and 2004 are as follows:

    Insured Exposure in Geographic Area Impacted          by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita


  
       
     
  
       
     Set forth below is a summary of the Company's        principal exposure as of December 31, 2005 to credits located in the        Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas counties designated by the        Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for “Individual and Public        Assistance” (excluding counties designated to receive only Category        A: Debris Removal and Category B: Emergency Protective Measures) as of        December 31, 2005 as a result of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Such exposure        consists solely of guaranteed public finance exposures. The Company has        no direct exposure to the City of New Orleans or to any other issuer        located in such City. The Company's asset-backed transactions have        not been included in the table set forth below as they are backed by        pools of geographically diverse assets with minimal concentration in        the areas affected. As of December 31, 2005, the Company has not been        notified of any claims associated with Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane        Rita. In addition, based on the Company's assessment of its exposures        in the affected areas and all related available information, it has not        established any reserves at such date. As additional information becomes        available, the Company will assess the need for reserves and make provision        therefore as considered necessary. Further new designations and/or reclassifications        of FEMA- designated counties by FEMA may occur. Accordingly, the table        below is subject to revision.

	Organization and Business


	

 

 
XL Financial Assurance Ltd. (the “Company”) was incorporated with limited liability under the Bermuda Companies Act 1981 on October 14, 1998 and is registered as a Class 3 insurer under The Insurance Act 1978,amendments thereto and related regulations (“The Act”). At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company was approximately 87% owned by XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd (a wholly-owned subsidiary of XL Capital Ltd); 5% by Financial Security AssuranceInc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Financial Security Assurance Holdings Ltd.) and 8% by Financial Security Assurance International Ltd. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Financial Security Assurance Inc.). The Company is an integral part of a jointventure agreement between XL Capital Ltd and Financial Security Assurance Holdings Ltd.


 

 
The Company is primarily engaged in the business of providing reinsurance of financial guaranties on asset- backed and municipal obligations underwritten by XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd, Financial Security Assurance Inc. andXL Capital Assurance Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of XL Capital Ltd) and other monoline and multiline insurance companies. This may be in the form of traditional financial guaranty insurance or via credit derivative executions. The Company'sunderwriting policy is to provide reinsurance of asset-backed and municipal obligations that would be of a lower investment-grade quality without the benefit of the Company's reinsurance. The asset-backed obligations reinsured by the Companyare generally issued in structured transactions and are backed by pools of assets such as residential mortgage loans, consumer or trade receivables, securities or other assets having ascertainable cash flows or market value. The municipalobligations reinsured by the Company consist primarily of general obligation bonds that are supported by the issuers' taxing power and of special revenue bonds and other special obligations of states and local governments that are supported by theissuers' ability to impose and collect fees and charges for public services or specific projects. The Company's reinsurance guarantees payments when due of scheduled payments on an insured obligation. In the case of a payment default on aninsured obligation, the Company is generally required to pay the principal, interest or other such amounts due in accordance with the obligations' original payment schedule or, at its option, to pay such amounts on an accelerated basis. TheCompany conducts surveillance on its exposures to try and ensure early identification of any loss events. In addition, in the normal course of business, the Company seeks to reduce the loss that may arise from such events by reinsuring certainlevels of risks in various areas of exposure with other insurance enterprises or reinsurers.

       Effective October 3, 2001, the Company entered          into an Excess of Loss Reinsurance Agreement with XL Insurance (Bermuda)          Ltd. This agreement covers a portion of the Company's liability          accruing as a result of losses occurring on policies written by the          Company that are in excess of certain limits and are not covered by          other reinsurance agreements. This agreement provides indemnification          only for the portion of any loss covered  in excess          of 10% of the Company's surplus, up to an aggregate amount of $500          million, and excludes coverage for liabilities arising other than pursuant          to the terms of an underlying policy. Additionally, the Company is          required to reduce any amounts due to it from XL Insurance (Bermuda)          Ltd under this agreement to the extent that prior losses for which          the Company has been previously reimbursed by XL Insurance (Bermuda)          Ltd has been subsequently reduced. Either party may terminate this          agreement, upon 30 days prior notice to the other party, if the Company          receives written notice from Moody's that the Company would be          able to maintain our financial strength rating without the benefit          of this agreement. Either party also may terminate this agreement upon          written notice to the other party and Moody's in the event of          certain specified circumstances, including insolvency of the other          party or acquisition of control of the other party by another entity.

       Effective August 17, 2001, the Company entered          into a Facultative Quota Share Reinsurance Treaty with XL Insurance          (Bermuda) Ltd. This treaty allows the Company to propose to cede to          XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd a portion of a risk insured by the Company          to it, which risk XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd may then accept or reject          in its sole discretion. This treaty will remain in effect until cancelled          by either party on 90 days prior notice. Either party also may immediately          terminate this treaty at any time, upon written notice to the other          party, in the event of certain specified circumstances, including,          but not limited to, insolvency of the other party or acquisition of          control of the other party by another entity. Under this treaty, XL          Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd pays the Company a ceding commission of 30%          on the premiums ceded under this treaty unless otherwise specified.

       Effective December 31, 1999, the Company          entered into a Facultative Quota Share Reinsurance Treaty with XL Insurance          (Bermuda) Ltd. This treaty allows XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd to propose          to cede to the Company a portion of a risk insured by it, which risk          the Company may then accept or reject in its sole discretion. This          treaty will remain in effect until cancelled by either party on 90          days prior notice. Either party also may immediately terminate this          treaty at any time, upon written notice to the other party, in the          event of certain specified circumstances, including, but not limited          to, insolvency of the other party or acquisition of control of the          other party by another entity.

       XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd guarantees our          obligations under our Second Amended and Restated Facultative Quota          Share Reinsurance Treaty with XLCA and our Master Facultative Reinsurance          Agreement with Financial Security Assurance Inc. and certain of its          subsidiaries and affiliates pursuant to Guarantees that XL Insurance          (Bermuda) Ltd executed on May 1, 2004 and November 3, 1998, respectively.

       The Company has provided its triple-A-rated          reinsurance to XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd in connection with certain          transactions that involve the Company providing a guarantee of XL Insurance          (Bermuda) Ltd's obligations to a client of XL Insurance (Bermuda)          Ltd that requires a triple-A-rated guaranty in addition to the “AA-” or “Aa3”-rated          guaranty provided by XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd. Each of these transactions          has a “double trigger” structure, meaning that the Company          does not have to pay a claim unless both the underlying transaction          and XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd defaults. For each of these transactions,          the Company has entered into a Reimbursement Agreement with XL Insurance          (Bermuda) Ltd, pursuant to which XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd pays the          Company a fee for providing its guarantee. XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd's          obligations to the Company under each Reimbursement Agreement are secured    under a corresponding Charge Agreement

The preparation of financial statements in          conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United          States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect          the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent          assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and          the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting          period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 

       Certain balances in prior periods have been          reclassified to conform with the current year's presentation.

      Premiums and Acquisition Costs

       Up-front premiums written and assumed are          earned on a pro-rata basis over the period the coverage is provided.          Installment premiums are recorded as written when reported and earned          over the related installment period, which is generally one year or          less. 

       Deferred premium revenue represents the portion          of reinsurance premiums written which is applicable to the unexpired          terms of policies in force. When a policy is retired or defeased prior          to the end of the expected period of coverage, the remaining deferred          premium, less any amount credited to a refunding issue reinsured by          the Company, is recognized in income at that time. 

       Certain costs incurred, relating to and varying          with the production of new business, have been deferred. These costs          include ceding commissions paid to the reinsured. The Company considers          the present value of future premiums under installment contracts written          when determining the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs.          The deferred acquisition costs are amortized over periods in which          the related premiums are earned, except for acquisition costs incurred          from business assumed from XLCA, which are amortized          over the weighted average periods that the related premiums are earned.          If an insured issue is retired or defeased prior to the end of the          expected period of coverage; the remaining deferred acquisition costs    with respect to such issue is recognized at such time.

    Reinsurance

       In the normal course of business, the Company          utilizes reinsurance agreements principally to increase aggregate capacity,          manage its risk guidelines and to reduce the risk of loss on business          assumed. Reinsurance premiums ceded are expensed and commissions recorded          thereon are earned on a pro-rata basis over the period the reinsurance          coverage is provided. Prepaid reinsurance premiums represent the portion          of premiums ceded that is applicable to the unexpired term of policies          in force. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner          consistent with the claim liability associated with the reinsured policy.          A provision is made for any estimated unrecoverable reinsurance. 

      Investments

       All of the Company's investments in          fixed maturity securities are considered available for sale and are          carried at fair value. The fair value of the investments is based on          quoted market values received from internationally recognized pricing          services or dealer quotes. Any resulting unrealized gains or losses          are reflected in other comprehensive income. Any unrealized depreciation          in value considered by management to be other than temporary is charged          to income in the period that it is determined.

       The company reviews the fair value of its          investment portfolio to identify declines in fair value that are other          than temporary. This review involves consideration of several factors          including (i) the time period during which there has been a significant          decline in value, (ii) an analysis of the liquidity, business prospects          and overall financial condition of the issuer, (iii) the significance          of the decline, (iv) an analysis of the collateral structure and other          credit support, as applicable, of the securities in question and (v)          the Company's intent and ability to hold the investment for a          sufficient period of time for the value to recover. Where the Company's          analysis of the above factors results in the Company's conclusion          that declines in fair values are other than temporary, the cost of          the security is written down to fair value and the previously unrealized          loss is therefore realized in the period such determination is made.

       With respect to securities where the decline          in value is determined to be temporary and the security's value          is not written down, a subsequent decision may be made to sell that          security and realize a loss. Subsequent decisions on security sales          are made within the context of overall risk monitoring, changing information,          market conditions generally and assessing value relative to other comparable          securities. 

       Bond discounts and premiums are amortized          on the effective yield method over the remaining terms of securities          acquired. For mortgage-backed securities, and any other holdings for          which prepayment risk may be significant, assumptions regarding prepayments          are evaluated periodically and revised as necessary. Any adjustments          required due to the resulting change in effective yields are recognized          in current income. 

       Short-term investments comprise securities          with maturities at acquisition equal to or greater than ninety days but          less than one year. All investment transactions are recorded on a trade          date basis. Realized gains and losses on sales of investments are determined          on the basis of specific identification. Investment income is recognized          when earned and includes interest together with the amortization of          premium and discount on fixed maturities and short-term investments. 

      Losses and Loss Expenses

       Reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses          include case basis reserves and unallocated loss reserves. Case specific          reserves for unpaid loss and loss expenses are recorded, as advised,          by the primary insurers. The primary insurers establish case reserves          for individual distressed credits when, in their management's          opinion, the future loss is deemed probable and estimable at the balance          sheet date. There is usually a single reporting period lag between          primary and reinsurer as it relates to the timing of any such case    specific reserves.

    In addition to case basis reserves, the          Company maintains an unallocated loss reserve for expected levels of          losses associated with currently insured issues, which is estimated          by management based upon an actuarial reserving analysis. The actuarial          methodology applied by the Company is in accordance with Actuarial          Standards of Practice No. 36, 
Determination          of Reasonable Provision

. This          methodology was adopted by the Company in 2002. The methodology applied          is based on the selection of an initial expected loss ratio, as well          as an expected loss emergence pattern. In accordance with the Company's          accounting policy, the initial expected loss ratio is applied to earned          premium each quarter and the expected loss emergence pattern is analyzed          on an annual basis as part of the Company's review of the overall          adequacy of the unallocated loss reserve recorded in the Company's          balance sheet. 

       The Company's selection of an initial          expected loss ratio and loss emergence pattern considered the characteristics          of the Company's own book of business as well its actual loss          experience and that of the industry. On an annual basis, the Company          compares its selected initial expected loss ratio to its actual loss          experience, as well as to industry loss experience, and will adjust          it as considered necessary, to ensure such initial expected loss ratio          continues to be appropriate for the risks in its in-force business.          In addition, the expected loss emergence pattern will be adjusted or          realigned on an annual basis, as considered necessary, to better correlate          with the underlying changes in the Company's in-force business          (e.g. changes in the average life of in-force business resulting from          changes in the mix of business and risk expiration). The Company's          unallocated reserve is available to be applied to new case basis reserves          that may be established for claims on current outstanding insured principal          and interest in the future.

      Cash and Cash Equivalents

       Cash equivalents include fixed interest deposits          with a maturity of under 90 days when purchased.

      Fair Value of Financial Instruments

       Fair values of certain assets and liabilities          are based on published market values, if available, or estimates of          fair value of similar issues. Fair values are reported in notes 4 and          21. 

      Derivative Instruments

       Credit derivatives are recorded at fair value,          which is determined using models developed by the Company and is dependent          upon a number of factors including changes in interest rates; future          default rates; credit spreads; changes in credit quality; future expected          recovery rates and other market factors. The change resulting from          movements in credit quality and spreads is unrealized as the credit          derivatives are not traded to realize this value although gains or losses could be recognized if a deal terminated early. This change and other elements of          the change in fair value, based upon pricing established at the          inception of the contract, are included in net realized and unrealized          gains and losses on derivative instruments as shown in the statement    of income.

    Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

       In November 2005, the Financial Accounting          Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”)          FAS 115-1, 
The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary          Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments

 to          finalize the guidance which was initially provided in EITF 03-1, on          (1) when an investment is considered impaired, (2) whether that impairment          is "other-than-temporary," (3) how to measure the impairment loss,          and (4) disclosures related to impaired securities. Because of concerns          about the application of EITF 03-1's guidance that described whether          an impairment is other-than-temporary, the FASB deferred the effective          date of that portion of EITF 03-1's guidance. This FSP officially nullifies          certain requirements of EITF 03-1's guidance on determining whether          an impairment is other-than-temporary, and effectively retains the          previous guidance in this area. The FSP generally carries forward EITF          03-1's guidance for determining when an investment is impaired, how          to measure the impairment loss, and what disclosures should be made          regarding impaired securities. The guidance is effective to reporting          periods beginning after December 15, 2005 and is not expected to have          a material impact on the Company's financial condition or results          of operations. 

       In May 2005, the FASB issued FAS No. 154, 
Accounting            Changes and Error Corrections

 (“FAS            154”), which changes the requirements for the accounting for            and reporting of changes in accounting principles. FAS 154 applies            to all voluntary changes in accounting principles and changes the            requirements for accounting for, and reporting of, changes in accounting            principles. FAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections            of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. 

       In March 2005, the FASB issued FSP FIN 46(R)-5, 
Implicit            Variable Interests Under FASB Interpretation No. 46(R)

 (“FSP            FIN 46(R)-5”), which requires an enterprise to consider whether            it holds an implicit variable interest in a Variable Interest Entity            (“VIE”) and what effect this may have on the calculation            of expected losses and residual returns of the VIE and the determination            of which party, if any, is considered the primary beneficiary of            the VIE. FSP FIN 46(R)-5 is effective for the first reporting period            beginning after March 3, 2005 and did not have a material impact            on the Company's financial condition or results of operations. 

       The Company is aware of the SEC's review          of loss reserving practices used in the financial guaranty industry.          The Company recognizes that there is diversity in practice among financial          guaranty insurers and reinsurers with respect to their accounting policies          for loss reserves. Current accounting literature, specifically FASB          Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 60 
Accounting          and Reporting by Insurance Enterprise

 (“FAS          60”) does not specifically address the unique characteristics          of financial guaranty insurance contracts. Consequently, the accounting          principles applied by the industry have evolved over time and incorporate          the concepts of both short-duration and long-duration contracts accounting          under the provisions of FAS 60 and other accounting literature such          as FAS 5 and EITF 85-20. In June 2005, the FASB unanimously agreed          to add a project to its agenda to address this matter and provide guidance          for the accounting for financial guaranty insurance contracts under          which it will consider claims liability recognition, premium recognition,          and the related amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs.          The Company will continue to apply its current loss reserving methodology    as noted above until further guidance is provided by the SEC or FASB.

    The Company has gross unrealized losses which it considers to be temporary impairments. Individual security positions comprising this balance have been evaluated by management, based on specified criteria, to determine if these impairments should be considered other than temporary. These criteria include an assessment of the severity and length of time securities have been impaired, along with management's ability and intent to hold the securities to recovery, among other factors. The Company has considered the continuous unrealized loss position greater than twelve months or more and, in its opinion, no permanent impairment has occurred as at December 31, 2005.

Actual maturities may differ from        contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or    prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties:

     During the year ended December 31, 2004, the        Company recorded a provision for losses of approximately $42.1 million        representing the present value of losses expected to be incurred in the        future with respect to an insured project financing. As this loss represented        a full limit loss to the subordinated tranche of the insured transaction,        the remaining unearned premium pertaining to such tranche, which aggregated        approximately $23.3 million, was fully earned resulting in an impact        on the Company's results of operations, before reinsurance, of approximately $18.8        million. The portion of the insured exposure to which this loss relates        was fully reinsured on a first loss basis by an affiliate of the Company        and, accordingly, there was no net impact on the Company's results        of operations from this loss provision. During 2005, the Company recorded    an additional provision for loss relating to this transaction    of $13.5 million ($5.6 million after reinsurance to affiliates), on a net present value basis to reflect certain adverse developments. The total remaining par insured by the Company in connection with this transaction aggregated approximately $203.4 million ($121.7 million net of reinsurance to affiliates) at December 31, 2005, and amortizes over many years into the future. The estimate of loss was  based on assumptions and estimates extending over many years into the future. There is currently no payment default with respect to this transaction. Management continues to monitor the exposure and will revise its loss estimate if necessary, as new information becomes available. Pursuant to the assumptions upon which the estimate was based, under its existing reinsurance arrangements, approximately 59.8% of any additional loss provision in excess of the amount currently provided will be retained by the Company.

For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 

       
     
  
      (U.S. dollars in thousands, except per share    amounts)

  
       
     
  
       
           The Company has recorded funds withheld of $15.9          million pursuant to its Treaty with XLCA in respect of notes (“Insured          Notes”) issued pursuant to a structured financing of loans to          medical providers, which were insured in 2001, and which defaulted          upon their maturity. XLCA has received a claim notice from the trustee          on behalf of the holders of such insured notes in the amount of $20.2          million, representing the outstanding principal of the Insured Notes          plus accrued interest thereon at the date of default (the “Claim          Amount”). Pursuant to the terms of the insurance arrangement,          XLCA had the option of satisfying the claim by either paying, in cash,          the Claim Amount to the holders of the Insured Notes or purchasing          the Insured Notes from such holders for an amount, in cash, equal to          the Claim Amount. XLCA elected to purchase the Insured Notes in satisfaction          of the claim. The purchase of the Insured Notes was recorded as an          investment in XLCA's balance sheet at their estimated fair value          of $19.5 million. The difference between the estimated fair value          and the consideration paid to acquire the Insured Notes was recorded          as a net paid loss of $0.1 million. Pursuant to the Treaty, XLCA classified its purchase of the Insured Notes          as in furtherance of defending or compromising a claim and  billed          the Company for its share of the cost of purchasing the notes and received          consideration from the Company in satisfaction thereof of $17.6          million. Subsequent to the purchase of the insured notes, a principal payment          was received in the amount of $1.7 million which reduced the funds          withheld balance to $15.9 million. The Company was also billed $0.6          million for its share of the initial loss which is reflected in “Net          losses and loss adjustment expenses”. 

       Income on the Insured Notes will be recognized           based on the effective yield method. Interest will be          correspondingly debited in an equal amount on the Company's funds          withheld asset. Interest income on the Insured Notes will be reflected          in the accompanying statement of operations under the caption “Net          investment income”.

       Under the effective yield method, the excess          of all cash flows expected from the Insured Notes at acquisition over          the Company's initial investment in the Insured Notes are recognized          as interest income on a level-yield basis over the expected life of          the Insured Notes. Subsequent increases in cash flows expected to be          collected are recognized prospectively through adjustment of the Insured          Notes' yield over their expected remaining life. Decreases in          cash flows expected to be collected are recognized as impairments and          will be reflected in the accompanying statement of operations under          the caption “Net realized losses on investments”. 

       The estimate of fair value of the Insured          Notes was based on XLCA's estimate of the fair value of the underlying          collateral which, as previously discussed, consisted of loans to medical          providers. Certain of these loans were made to Intrepid USA Healthcare          Services (“Intrepid”), a national provider of home nursing          services to patients with acute illnesses. Intrepid declared bankruptcy          in 2004. On February 3, 2006, Intrepid emerged from bankruptcy. In          connection, therewith, in February 2006, XLCA accepted preferred stock          of Intrepid in exchange for the cancellation of a portion of the Insured          Notes. This preferred stock is in-substance common stock, as defined          in EITF 02-14, 
Whether an          Investor Should Apply the Equity Method of Accounting to Investments          Other Than Common Stock

,    and represents a 49% ownership interest in Intrepid. In connection with, and critical to, Intrepid's emergence from bankruptcy was certain exit financing obtained by Intrepid. Pursuant to the terms of the related credit agreement, Intrepid must achieve certain financial targets over certain periods of time. In certain cases, if such targets are not met, the provider of such financing may foreclose on all ownership interest in Intrepid. If the provider of the financing foreclosed on all ownership interest in Intrepid which is not expected by management, the Company would be required to write-off the carrying value of this investment, which was approximately $12.2 million at December 31, 2005.

      (U.S. dollars in thousands, except per share    amounts)

  
       
     
  
       
           During 2005, the Company recorded a provision          for loss of $4.3 million ($2.5 million net of reinsurance)          representing the present value loss expected to be incurred in the          future with respect to an insured residential mortgage securitization.          The total remaining par reinsured by the Company in connection with          this transaction aggregated approximately $224.5 million ($130.6          million net of reinsurance), and amortizes over many years into the          future. The estimate of loss was based on assumptions and          estimates extending over many years into the future. There is currently          no payment default with respect to this transaction. Management continues          to monitor the exposure and revise its loss estimates if necessary,          as new information becomes available. 

       The Company maintains a provision of $1.4          million in respect of reinsurance provided to a primary insurer for a cash          flow collateralised borrowing obligation. The estimate of loss is based          on current assumptions, although no claim is expected to be paid until          the legal maturity of principal in 2011 if at all. 

       The Company commenced writing financial guaranty          business in 1998 and had relied entirely upon industry data to establish          reserves until the end of 2001. Beginning in 2002, the Company developed          an initial expected loss ratio as well as an expected loss emergence          pattern based on the characteristics of the Company's own book          of business as well as its actual loss experience and that of the industry.          On an annual basis, a comparison is made with actual Company loss experience          as well as with industry loss experience to ensure the initial expected          loss ratio continues to be appropriate for the portfolio of risks covered.          In cases where the initial expected loss ratio appears to be misaligned          with the reported losses or the industry loss experience, the accretion          rate is adjusted for consistency. The current year assessment has not          identified that the initial expected loss ratio need be adjusted. In          addition, the emergence pattern is realigned to better track with the          underlying changes in the book of business on an annual basis. Since          the actual accrual to date has been in excess of the expected loss          emergence pattern, there has been a decrease in the estimate of reserves          for prior years in order to bring the reserves in line with the actuarial    expectation.

    Premiums and Reinsurance



  
       
     
  
       
    The Company utilizes reinsurance agreements          principally to increase aggregate capacity, manage its risk guidelines          and to reduce the risk of loss on business assumed. The Company's          reinsurance agreements provide for recovery of a portion of losses          and loss expenses from reinsurers and reinsurance recoverables are          recorded as assets. The Company is liable if the reinsurers are unable          to satisfy their obligations under the agreements. 

       The effect of reinsurance activity on premiums    written and earned is shown below:

    Derivative Instruments



  
       
     
  
       
     Credit derivatives issued by the Company meet        the definition of a derivative under FAS 133. The Company has recorded        these products at fair value, modeled on prevailing market conditions        and certain other factors relating to the structure of the transaction.        The Company considers credit derivatives to be financial guaranty contracts,        in substance, as the Company intends to hold them to maturity. The Company        determines fair value using a model which calculates the difference between        the actual remaining present value of installment premiums and an estimated        remaining present value of installment premiums under current market        conditions. In essence, the model estimates the cost of an offsetting        position to the original credit derivatives from other comparable counterparties        under the current market environment. The model is dependent upon a number        of factors including changes in credit spreads, changes in credit quality,    foreign exchange and other market factors.

Notes to Financial Statements 
For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 

       
     
  
      (U.S. dollars in thousands, except per share    amounts)

  
       
     
  
       
    The Company's credit derivatives portfolio          generally requires the Company to meet payment obligations for referenced          credits within the portfolio in the event of specific credit events          after erosion or exhaustion of various first loss protection levels.          These credit events are contract specific, but generally cover bankruptcy,          failure to pay and repudiation. The notional exposure of the credit          derivatives portfolio as of December 31, 2005 was $6.5 billion.          Approximately 97% and 2% of the portfolio is rated AAA and BBB, respectively,          with the remainder being split amongst AA and A. The weighted average          term of the contracts in force was 3.70 years.

       The net fair value adjustment for the years          ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was an unrealized gain (loss)          of ($2,220), $11,959 and $15,137, respectively. At December          31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company had a net credit derivatives asset of $11,618, $15,727 and $3,788, respectively. 

       In 2005, the Company amended the presentation          of credit derivatives transactions in the Statements of Income to include          certain components of the transactions in “gross premiums written”, “net          premiums earned”, “net losses and loss expense incurred” and “fee          and other income”, and certain components of the change in fair          value in “unpaid loss and loss expenses.” Previously components          on the transactions and the change in fair value were reflected in          one line item under “Net realized and unrealized gains and losses          on derivative instruments”, and the fair value had been reflected          in “Derivative assets” and “Derivative liabilities.” There          was no effect on net income as a result of this change and prior period          results have been reclassified to reflect this presentation. This change          in presentation is applicable only to credit default swaps assumed          by the Company that are investment grade and that the Company intends          and has the ability to hold to maturity and is consistent with practices          in the financial guaranty insurance industry for reporting the results          of such instruments. Results of the prior period presented have been          reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. The effect    of the reclassification is outlined as follows:

     The Company reinsures interest rate swaps        indirectly as part of financial guarantee reinsurance of XLCA. The swap        portion of these insurance contracts is required to be measured and recorded        at fair value. The valuation methodology comprises of a mark to model        approach that measures the change in expected loss. The expected loss        is driven by the valuation of the underlying derivative; the default        probability of the underlying obligor and the expected recovery rate        on the underlying asset class. The net unrealized loss recognized on    these swap

	Variable Interest Entities


	

 

 
	The Company primarily provides financial guaranty reinsurance or enters into a credit derivative on the senior interests, which would otherwisebe rated investment grade. The obligations related to these transactions areoften securitized through variable interest entities. The Company does not hold any equity positions or subordinated debt in these arrangements.The Company does not have a significant variable interest  in these entities and,therefore, these entities are not consolidated.

	Shareholders' Equity and Redeemable Preferred Shares


	

 

 
	The Company was initially incorporated with an authorized share capital of $120,000 comprising 1,000 common shares of a par value $120 per share. These shares were issued to XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd on October 28,1998. On November 3, 1998 the Company increased its authorized capital to $2.4 million divided into 10,000 common shares of a par value $120 per share and 10,000 Series A cumulative participating voting redeemable preferred shares(“Series A Redeemable Preferred Shares”) of par value $120 per share. Immediately thereafter, the Company issued 200 Series A Redeemable Preferred Shares to Financial Security Assurance Inc. for a consideration of $99,500 per shareand issued 800 common shares to XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd for a consideration of $100,000 per share. Thereafter, the initial 1,000 common shares were repurchased pursuant to a share repurchase agreement at par. On February 3, 1999 the Companyrepurchased 50 Series A Redeemable Preferred Shares for a consideration of $98,000 per share from Financial Security Assurance Inc. Simultaneously, the Company issued an additional 50 common shares to XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd for aconsideration of $100,000 per share, of which 98% ($4.9 million) was paid.
	

 

 
	On December 6, 2000 the Company, pursuant to a share subscription agreement, issued an additional 213 Series A Redeemable Preferred Shares for a cash consideration of $24 million to Financial Security AssuranceInternational Ltd. and an additional 1,207 Common Shares for a consideration of $136 million to XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd. The consideration in respect of the Common Shares was settled in part with fixed maturity securities with a fair marketvalue of $132 million. The remainder was settled with cash. On December 7, 2004 the Series A preferred shareholder waived their anti-dilution rights which allowed the Company, pursuant to a share subscription agreement, to issue an additional392 Common Shares for a consideration of $125 million to XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd. The consideration in respect of the Common Shares was settled in part with fixed maturity securities of $125,572 and cash of $876 and an inter-companypayable of $1,448, which was settled in 2005.
	

 

   
   On December 7, 2004 the Company, subject to      a written resolution to its Bye-Laws created a new class of preferred shares - “Series      B Preferred Shares”. These shares were created in conjunction with      the establishment of the Asset Trust (see note 13). The Series B Preferred      Shares are non-cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred shares with a      par value of $120 per share. The Series B preferred shares rank prior      to the Common and Series A Redeemable Preferred Shares of the Company and      have a liquidation preference of $100,000 each. In the event that the      Company exercises its put option to the Asset Trust and the Series B preferred      shares are issued, the holders of outstanding Series B Preferred Shares      shall be entitled to receive, in preference to the holders of the Common      and Redeemable Preferred Shares, cash dividends at a percentage rate per    Series B Preferred Share as follows:

The Series B Preferred Shares may be redeemed, in          whole or in part, at the option of the Company at any time or from          time to time for cash at a redemption price equal to the liquidation          preference per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon          to the date of redemption without interest on such unpaid dividends.          However, the Series B Preferred Shares may not be redeemed, in whole          or in part, at the option of the Company at any time prior to December          10, 2009.

       The holders of the Series A Redeemable Preferred          Shares are entitled to one vote per share and are entitled to receive          a 5% Fixed Dividend on the amount initially paid for the Series A Redeemable          Preferred Shares, plus, a participating dividend. 

       At any time, the Series A Redeemable Preferred          Shares are redeemable by the Company in whole but not in part at its          sole option at a redemption price equal to the sum of (i) the fair          market value of such Series A Redeemable Preferred Shares, subject          to the Cap (maximum calculated rate of return of 19%) and the Floor          (minimum calculated rate of return of 8%), plus (ii) the excess, if          any, of (A) a preferred percentage of the Company's Earnings,          if any, in the fiscal year in which the date of redemption occurs up          to the date of the redemption, as calculated by the Company over (B)          Total Dividends paid to the Series A Redeemable Preferred Shareholders          in such fiscal year; provided that the sum of the accreted value of          all distributions to Series A Redeemable Preferred Shareholders plus          the redemption price shall not exceed 15% of the sum of the accreted          value of all distributions plus the aggregate fair market value of          the capital stock of the Company. At any time after the tenth anniversary          of the date of the initial issue, the Series A Preferred Shares are          redeemable in whole but not in part at the election of the Series A          Preferred Shareholders at their sole option at a redemption price equal          to fair market value provided that the sum of the accreted value of          all distributions to Series A Redeemable Preferred Shareholders plus          the redemption price shall not exceed 15% of the sum of the accreted          value of all distributions plus the aggregate fair market value of          the capital stock of the Company. The fair market value for redemption          purposes shall be determined by mutual agreement of both Series A Preferred          and Common Shareholders. 

       In the event of a winding-up or dissolution          of the Company whether voluntary or involuntary or for the purposes          of a reorganization or otherwise, or upon any distribution of capital,          the Series A Redeemable Preferred Shareholders shall be entitled, to          the extent of the availability of assets of the Company and in priority          to the Common Shareholders, to receive an amount (the “Dissolution          Amount”) equal to the sum of (i) the amount initially paid for          the Series A Redeemable Preferred Shares, (ii) additional capital contributions          paid by the Series A Redeemable Preferred Shareholders, (iii) any accrued          and unpaid Fixed Dividends and (iv) the preferred percentage of residual          Earnings of the Company, if any in the fiscal year in which winding-up          or dissolution occurs, less the Total Dividends previously paid to          the holders of the Series A Preferred Shares in respect of such fiscal          year and (v) 13% of the cumulative undistributed residual earnings          of the Company from inception of the Company through the end of the          fiscal year preceding the year in which the winding-up or dissolution          occurs provided that the Series A Redeemable Preferred Shareholders          shall not be entitled to any further or other right of participation    in the assets of the Company.

     The Company limits its exposure to losses        from writing financial guaranties by underwriting investment-grade obligations        and diversifying its portfolio and maintaining rigorous collateral requirements        on asset-backed obligations. The gross principal amounts of reinsured        obligations in the asset-backed reinsured portfolio are backed by the    following types of collateral as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 (in millions):

    In its asset-backed business, the Company          considers its overall geographic concentration as a factor in underwriting          reinsurance covering securitizations of pools of such assets as residential          mortgages or consumer receivables. In writing reinsurance for other          types of asset-backed obligations, such as securities primarily backed          by government or corporate debt, geographic concentration is not deemed          by the Company to be significant, given other more relevant measures          of diversification, such as issuer or industry. 

       The Company seeks to maintain a diversified          portfolio of reinsured municipal obligations designed to spread its          risk across a number of geographic areas. The following table sets          forth, by state and territory of the United States, those states and          territories in which municipalities located therein issued an aggregate    of 2% or more of

     Exposure Implications of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita


 
  
       
  
       
     Set forth below is a summary of the Company's principal exposure as of December 31, 2005 to credits located in the Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas counties designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”) for “Individual and Public Assistance” (excluding counties designated to receive only Category A: Debris Removal and Category B: Emergency Protective Measures) as of December 31, 2005 as a result of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Such exposure consists solely of guaranteed public finance exposures. The Company has no direct exposure to the City of New Orleans or to any other issuer located in such City. The Company's asset-backed transactions have not been included in the table set forth below as they are backed by pools of geographically diverse assets with minimal concentration in the areas affected. As of December 31, 2005, the Company has not been notified of any claims associated with Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane Rita. In addition, based on the Company's assessment of its exposures in the affected areas and all related available information, it has not established any reserves at such date. As additional information becomes available, the Company will assess the need for reserves and make provision as considered necessary. Further new designations and/or reclassifications of FEMA- designated counties by FEMA may occur.

	Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments


	

 

 
	For financial instruments other than derivative instruments (see note 8), estimated fair values have been determined by the Company, using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. However,considerable judgment is necessary to interpret the data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amount the Company could realize in a current market exchange. The useof different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the following estimated fair value amounts.
	

 

 
	Fixed-maturity investments

	

 

 
	The carrying amount represents fair value, which is based primarily on quoted market prices received from a nationally recognized pricing service or dealer quotes.
	

 

 
	Short-term investments

	

 

 
	The carrying amount represents fair value, which approximates cost due to the short maturity of these instruments.
	

 

 
	Cash and cash equivalents

	

 

 
	The carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of approximate fair value because of the short maturity term of these instruments.
	

 

 
	Deferred premium revenue

	

 

 
	The carrying amount of deferred premium revenue represents the Company's future premium revenue on policies where the premium was received at the inception of the reinsurance contract. The fair value of deferred premiumrevenue is an estimate of the premiums that would be paid under a reinsurance agreement

    with a third party to transfer the remaining          term of the Company's financial guaranty risk, net of that portion          of the premiums retained by the Company to compensate it for originating          and servicing the reinsurance contract. 

       Installment premiums 


       Consistent with industry practice, there          is no carrying amount for future installment premiums since the Company          will receive premiums on an installment basis over the term of the          reinsurance contract. Similar to deferred premium revenue, the fair          value of installment premiums is the estimated present value of the          future contractual premium revenues that would be paid under a reinsurance          agreement with a third party to transfer the remaining term of the          Company's financial guaranty risk, net of that portion of the premium          retained by the Company to compensate it for originating and servicing          the reinsurance contract. The fair value is derived by calculating          the present value of the estimated future cash flow stream (net premium          and ceding commissions) discounted at 7% and 3.61% as of December          31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company has determined that the          costs for originating and servicing the contract would be immaterial          and that the carrying value and the estimated fair value would be approximately          the same. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the fair value of such installment          premiums was approximately $223.4 million and $212.1 million,          respectively.

       Unpaid losses and loss expenses 


       The carrying amount is fair value, which          is the present value of the expected cash flows for specifically identified    claims and potential losses in the Company's reinsured portfolio.
