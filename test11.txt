    We believe that the Wireline Sale will enable us to take    advantage of the increasing demand for broadband wireless    services, which has been precipitated by customer adoption of    higher bandwidth cellular services such as third generation (3G)    and Evolution Data Only (EV-DO) entertainment and media services    delivered to mobile wireless devices. We believe that now is the    appropriate time to shift the focus of our business model from    our Wireline Business to our Wireless business for the following    reasons:
 
    
    
    

     
        • 
        the costs of purchasing and deploying wireless communications    equipment have declined significantly over the last several    years, and we are now positioned to deploy our fixed wireless    equipment in a more cost-effective manner than our traditional    wireline services;

 


     
        • 
        There is a greater recognition of the need for redundancy in the    technologies included in communications networks;

 

     
        • 
        the increased costs of fiber and copper network facilities due    to FCC rulemaking permitting the ILECs to increase prices for    such facilities is expected to increase the cost of providing    traditional wireline services
