ITEM 7.

     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


     This “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contains forward-looking statements which involve inherent risks and uncertainties.Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about the Company's beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. These statements are based upon current plans, estimates and expectations. Actual results may differmaterially from those projected in such forward-looking statements, and therefore undue reliance should not be placed on them. See “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” for a list of additional factors that could causeactual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.

     This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto presented under Item 8.

     Certain aspects of the Company's business have loss experience characterized as low frequency and high severity. This may result in volatility in both the Company's results ofoperations and financial condition.

Executive Overview

     The Company operates on a global basis primarily in the property and casualty industry and, to a lesser extent, the financial services industry. The Company serves the insurance, reinsuranceand financial services needs of institutional and corporate clients, typically the global equivalent of the Fortune 2000. The Company operates in markets where the Company believes its underwriting expertise and financial strength represent arelative advantage. The Company does not operate in any retail markets.

     The property and casualty insurance and reinsurance markets have historically been cyclical, meaning that based on market conditions, there have been periods where premium rates are high andpolicy terms and conditions are more favorable (a “hard market”) to the Company and there have been periods where premium rates decline and policy terms and conditions are less favorable (a “soft market”) to the Company. This hasbeen driven primarily by competition in the marketplace, the supply of capital in the industry, investment yields and the frequency and severity of loss events. Management's goal is to build long-term shareholder value by capitalizing oncurrent opportunities and managing through any potential downward cycles by reducing its property and casualty book of business and exposures if and when rates deteriorate to unprofitable levels for the Company. As part of its long-term strategy,the Company also looks to its financial products and services segment to provide a diversified stream of earnings that are not directly tied to the property and casualty cycle. In this regard, the Company's financial guaranty operations havesubstantially achieved relative trading parity with its peers.

     The Company has grown through acquisition activity and development of new business opportunities. Acquisitionsincluded Global Capital Underwriting Ltd in 1996, Mid Ocean Limited in 1998,ECS, Inc. and NAC Re Corp. in 1999, Winterthur International in 2001 and Le MansRÉ in 2002. All acquisitions have supportedthe Company's strategic plan to develop a global platform in insurance and reinsurance. Recent business developments include XL Capital Assurance Inc. and XL Financial Assurance Ltd., the Company's financial guaranty primary andreinsurance guarantors, XL Weather & Energy Inc. and XL Life Insurance & AnnuityCompany. As a result of these combined developments, the Company now competesas an integrated global business with more than 3,500 employees in 29 countries.

     The Company earns its revenue primarily from net premiums written and earned. Premium rates in the property and casualty industry began to increase in 2001 following five years of poorunderwriting performance in the industry. These price increases were further compounded by the September 11 event. In the three years ended December 31, 2003, the Company experienced pricing increases and improved terms and conditions across most ofthe lines of business it writes. These generally across-the-board price increases were unprecedented, meaning that, in the past, pricing increases and more favorable terms and conditions were not experienced across all of the Company's productlines at one point in any one cycle.

50

     During 2004, property and casualty market conditions overall remained attractive although price competition increased throughout the year, most notably in regards to property and professionallines. Accordingly, the Company continued to focus on disciplined risk selection. In relation to insurance and reinsurance, downward pressure on rates across most non-catastrophe exposed lines continued throughout 2005 although the impact of the2004 storm season, the backdrop of continued emergence of adverse development related to the market of the late 1990s and concerns about reinsurer financial strength, all served to reinforce a sense of discipline in the market.

     Subsequent to the unprecedented catastrophic losses in 2005 and into the 2006 first quarter renewals, the market in general has seen an improvement in terms and conditions as well as pricing,in particular in geographic territories and classes impacted by the catastrophe losses. Casualty and professional lines, which have seen significant price reductions in 2004 and 2005, have begun to stabilize. In the Reinsurance segment, however,these improvements have been offset somewhat by increased ceding company retentions which is common in a hardening market. While the Company is not focused on top line premium growth unless it is profitable and meets demanding standards and internalhurdle rates, the Company's expectation is for flat earned premium growth for the full year of 2006, with insurance contributing flat to low single digit growth and reinsurance contributing flat to mid-single digit declines.

     The Company also generates revenue from investment activities through returns on its investment portfolio. The Company's current investment strategy seeks to support the liabilitiesarising from the operations of the Company, generate investment income and build book value over the longer term. During both 2005 and 2004, interest rates in the U.S. increased. During 2005, the U.S. yield curve flattened significantly, as short tomedium term rates increased significantly while long-term rates showed a small decline. The benchmark 90-day treasury rose from 2.22% to 4.08% and the 5-year treasury rose from 3.61% to 4.35%, while the 30-year treasury fell from 4.83% to 4.54% .Interest rates declined in the U.K., where the yield on the benchmark 5-year Gilt fell from 4.49% to 4.17%, however, in the Euro-zone, the yield on the benchmark 5-year German Bund rose slightly from 3.03% to 3.07% .

     The Company expects net investment income to rise in 2006 supported by positive cash flow from operating activities and anticipated moderate increases in market interest rates.

     In 2005, the Company generated net realized gains from both its equity and fixed income portfolios, reflecting the current and accumulated performance of the capital markets. In 2004, theCompany generated net realized gains from both its equity and fixed income portfolios reflecting the overall performance of capital markets and the deterioration of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies. In 2003, the Company generated netrealized gains from both its equity and fixed income portfolios reflecting the overall improvement in capital markets and narrowing of credit spreads.

     The Company's profitability in any given period is based upon its premium and investment revenues as noted above, less net losses incurred and expenses. Net losses incurred are based uponclaims paid and changes to unpaid loss reserves. Unpaid loss reserves are estimated by the Company and include both reported loss reserves and reserves for losses incurred but not reported. The Company's results for 2005 were significantlyimpacted by the unprecedented insured hurricane losses during the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, the charge related to the conclusion of the independent actuarial process with Winterthur Swiss Insurance Company and adverse development of prior yearloss reserves in both insurance professional lines and reinsurance casualty lines. The Company's results for 2004 were also significantly impacted by the catastrophe activity in the year, which resulted in $591.2 million in estimated netloss and loss expenses, combined with adverse prior year development in certain lines of the Company's insurance segment. For a further discussion of these events see “Results of Operations” below.

     Financial measures

     The following are some of the financial measures management considers important in evaluating the Company's operating performance in the Company's general operations:

      Underwriting profit (loss) - general operations

     One way that the Company evaluates the performance of its insurance and reinsurance general operations is the underwriting profit or loss. The Company does not measure performance based on theamount of gross premiums written. Underwriting profit or loss is calculated from premiums earned and fee income, less net losses incurred and expenses related to the underwriting activities. As noted above, the Company's underwriting profit andloss for the last three years have been negatively impacted by net losses incurred from catastrophic losses, the results of the independent actuarial process with Winterthur Swiss Insurance Company and adverse development of prior year lossreserves. Partially offsetting this has been the addition of certain new business lines, the increase in premium rates in 2003 and favorable underwriting terms and conditions. Any changes to loss reserves affect the calculation of underwritingprofit or loss but most often do not directly affect the Company's cash flow in the same period. See further discussion below. Barring any unusual catastrophic loss events, the Company expects to produce an underwriting profit in2006.

     Combined ratio - general operations

     The combined ratio for general operations is used by the Company and many other insurance and reinsurance companies as another measure of underwriting profitability. The combined ratio iscalculated from the net losses incurred and underwriting expenses as a ratio of the net premiums earned for the Company's general insurance and reinsurance operations. A combined ratio of less than 100% indicates an underwriting profit and over100% indicates an underwriting loss. The Company's combined ratio for the last three years have been negatively impacted by the factors affecting the underwriting profit (loss), noted above.

     Net investment income - general operations

     Net investment income from its general operations is an important measure that affects the Company's overall profitability. The largest liability of the Company relates to its unpaid lossreserves and the Company's investment portfolio provides liquidity for claims settlements of these reserves as they become due, and thus a significant part of the portfolio is in fixed income securities. Net investment income is primarilyaffected both by the size of the portfolio and the level of market interest rates. In 2005, the U.S. yield curve flattened significantly with U.S. short to medium term interest rates increasing markedly while long term rates showed a small decline.U.K. rates declined, while in the Euro-zone short term rates rose while medium to long term rates declined. In 2004, U.S. interest rates increased moderately while interest rates in the U.K. and Euro-zone declined. The size of the portfolio is alsoimpacted by cash flow generated from operations and financing, which has been positive during the last three years and which the Company currently expects to be positive in 2006.

     Book value per ordinary share

     Management also views the change in the Company's book value per ordinary share as an additional measure of the Company's performance. Book value per share is calculated by dividingordinary shareholders' equity by the number of outstanding ordinary shares at any period end. Book value per ordinary share is affected primarily by

52

the Company's net income and also by any changes in the net unrealized gains and losses on its investment portfolio. The Company's book value per ordinary share decreased in 2005 as a result of the underwritinglosses incurred, partially offset by the significant capital-raising during December 2005, where ordinary shares were issued at a premium to the book value at that time. During 2005, book value per share also decreased as a result of a decrease inthe unrealized gains on the Company's investment portfolio. The decrease was primarily as a result of increasing short to medium term U.S. interest rates, partially offset by declining longer term U.K. interest rates. The Company's bookvalue per ordinary share increased in 2004, primarily as a result of an increase in net income combined with an increase in the net unrealized gains on the investment portfolio. The increase in unrealized gains on the Company's fixed incomeportfolio was primarily a result of the foreign exchange benefits for non-U.S. dollar investments partially offset by a moderate increase in interest rates in the U.S.

     Return on average ordinary shareholders' equity

     Return on average ordinary shareholder's equity (“ROE”) is a widely used measure of any company's profitability. It is calculated by dividing the net income for any periodby the average of the opening and closing ordinary shareholders' equity. The Company establishes minimum target ROEs for its total operations, segments and lines of business. If the Company's minimum ROE targets over the longer term arenot met with respect to any line of business, the Company seeks to modify and/or exit these lines. In addition, the Company's compensation of its senior officers is significantly dependent on the achievement of the Company's performancegoals to enhance shareholder value as measured by ROE. The Company reported a loss in 2005 and ROEs for the prior two years have been negatively affected mainly by its general operations' underwriting results and investment income.

Other Key Focuses of Management


     Ratings and Capital Management


     The Company's ability to underwrite business is largely dependent upon the quality of its claims paying and financial strength ratings as evaluated by independent rating agencies. As aresult, in the event that the Company's financial strength rating is downgraded, its ability to write business will be adversely affected. Such a downgrade would also adversely affect the Company's financial guaranty lines of business.During the third and fourth quarters of 2005 a number of ratings actions were taken by independent rating agencies including some downgrades of the Company's principal insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries. The Company subsequently raised$3.2 billion through an issuance of a combination of ordinary shares and equity security units. The financial strength ratings of the Company's financial guaranty companies remain “triple A” with a stable outlook (by Standard& Poor's, Moody's and Fitch Ratings). For a further discussion see “Ratings” above.

     To address rating agency requirements regarding the differential between the triple-A ratings of the Company's financial guaranty companies and their affiliated companies,management is currently exploring a number of strategies that would provide greater independence and stability to XLCA's and XLFA's ratings. Examples of actions identified by the rating agencies are, among other things, the inclusion ofadditional independent directors to the boards of directors of the Company's financial guaranty companies; adding some level of outside high-quality ownership with voting and/or veto rights; and securing a resolution from each of the boards ofdirectors of the Company's financial guaranty companies that clarifies our expectations regarding cash payments from the financial guaranty companies. S&P has stated that one or more of these actions will need to be taken by mid-year2006.

     In the normal course of business, the Company evaluates its capital needs to support the volume of business written in order to maintain its claims paying and financial strength ratings. Inresponse to the unprecedented insured hurricane losses during the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, the loss related to the conclusion of the independent actuarial process with WSIC, rising capital requirements for the property catastrophe businessfrom rating agencies and the currently anticipated growth in business to be written in 2006, the Company raised $3.2 billion in capital through the issuance of a combination of ordinary shares and equity security units. In addition, the Companyhas implemented several key business initiatives with ratings and capital management implications.

1.     

Management has entered into a strategic initiative intended to augment the Company's overall underwriting capacity to take advantage of opportunities in certain catastrophe-exposed lines of business. Management hasentered into a collateralized quota share reinsurance treaty with Cyrus Reinsurance Limited. Under this agreement, as of January 1, 2006, the Company cedes specified portions of the Company's property catastrophe reinsurance and retrocessionlines of business.

2.

Management continues to reduce the Company's net catastrophe exposed risks. In the Insurance segment, management continues to reduce exposure to accounts that have the potential for significant volatility underwors-

53

    ening catastrophe event scenarios, reduce catastrophe        sublimits and eliminate accounts that no longer meet the Company's        increased pricing needs. In addition to the strategic initiative noted        above, the Reinsurance segment's management intends to reduce catastrophe        exposure within the property risk portfolio and restructure the way in    which marine excess of loss programs are written.

     Operational Efficiency and Effectiveness

     The Company's ability to compete is influenced by its operational efficiency and effectiveness, including the development and retention of its people. In recognition of this, the Companyhas in place and continues to develop, programs and initiatives aimed at enhancing its position in these areas. For example, the Company continues to make significant investments in information technology in both the Insurance and Reinsurancesegments, develop and implement a new framework for Financial Reporting and Controls, and establish an operations center, based in, India. Each of these projects requires considerable investment and commitment of the Company's resources in aneffort to achieve the ultimate goals of increased operational efficiency and effectiveness.

     Collateral Management

     Another important matter on which management is focused (and which also affects the Company's ability to underwrite business) is the availability of collateral. Collateral includes lettersof credit, insurance trusts and other credit facilities required to provide security to cedants (which are companies who reinsure their liabilities to the Company), particularly as required by state insurance regulation in the U.S. and atLloyd's, and also to provide the Company with liquidity as required. These facilities are provided to the Company from commercial banks. Our principal credit facilities have tenors of two, three, and five years. The Company has also utilized“off balance sheet” transactions in order to obtain more collateral capacity (these transactions are described below under “Variable Interest Entities and Other Off Balance Sheet Arrangements”). As the Company writes morebusiness, its collateral requirements will increase. A key challenge for management is to ensure that sufficient collateral capacity is available as to not hinder future writing of business.

     Liquidity and cash flow

     As a property and casualty insurer, the Company must ensure that it has sufficient funds to settle claims promptly, especially upon the occurrence of a major catastrophic event. Management isfocused on making sure that liquidity requirements are supported by having lines of credit facilities available to the Company as well as by the Company's general investment portfolio of which the majority is in high grade fixed incomesecurities. The Company has had significant positive cash flow from operations in the three years ended December 31, 2005 generated from its underwriting activities (premiums less claim and expense settlements) as well as the receipt of investmentincome on its portfolio. In addition during 2005, capital raising activity provided significant cash flows from financing activities. The Company expects cash flow from operations to be positive in 2006.

      The Company's net (loss) income and other financial measures as shown above for the three years ended December 31 have been affected, among other things, by the following significantitems:

1)     

Significant large catastrophe activity;

2)

The impact of the unvaforable result of the independent actuarial process with Winterthur Swiss Insurance Company;

3)

Net adverse prior year loss development in general insurance and reinsurance operations;

4)

Growing asset base and positive performance from investments in affiliates.

     1. Significant large catastrophe activity (Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and other natural catastrophes)


     During the third and fourth quarters of 2005, there was an unprecedented number of natural catastrophes. In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina, a Category 4 storm, hit the Gulf Coast of the UnitedStates and is estimated to have caused the largest ever insured loss from a natural disaster in the property and casualty insurance industry. In September 2005, Hurricane Rita, a Category 3 storm, hit the Gulf Coast on the United States and causedconsiderable damage, although Rita was less severe than Katrina. In October 2005, Hurricane Wilma hit South Florida after causing significant damage in Mexico and Cuba. In addition, there were several other natural loss events in the third andfourth quarter 2005, including hurricanes Dennis, Emily and Ophelia, the European and Mumbai Floods and Typhoon Mawar (collectively, the “Other Cats”). Collectively, Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Wilma, and these Other Cats have had asubstantial impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.

     As a result of the substantial impact the Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Wilma and the Other Cats have had on the results of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company hasestimated losses incurred, net of reinsurance recoveries, of $1.27 billion, $357.9 million and $247.1 million and $96.0 million, respectively, based on preliminary reports and estimates of such loss and damage. The Company hasperformed an analysis of contracts it believes are exposed to these catastrophes and, together with other preliminary information received from insureds and cedents and industry models, has determined its best estimates at this time for the expectedultimate loss. Actual losses may vary materially from this estimate based on a number of factors, including receipt of additional information from insureds or brokers, the attribution of losses to coverages and/or layers that had not previously beenconsidered as exposed and inflation in repair costs due to additional demand for labor and materials. In addition, the loss estimate includes a high level of uncertainty related to, among other things, complex coverage issues associated withHurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma and potential legal developments that may result in ultimate losses not being known for a considerable period of time. Therefore, losses may ultimately be materially greater or lesser than the current estimate andaccordingly impact future financial results. Losses in connection with these events were incurred almost equally from the Company's Insurance and Reinsurance segments.

55

     The year ended December 31, 2004 was negatively impacted by four hurricanes, Frances, Charley, Ivan and Jeanne, for a total net loss of $516.6 million, net of reinsurance recoveries. Inaddition, the Company incurred net losses and loss expenses of $74.6 million in 2004 as a result of the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami that struck South Asia on December 26, 2004.

     The following are analyses of the financial impact on the Company's results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 from natural catastrophes:

      2. Losses related to the result of the independent actuarial process with Winterthur Swiss Insurance Company


     On December 6, 2005, the Company received the report from the Independent Actuary in connection with the Company's post-closing protection for adverse development of net loss and unearnedpremium relating to the acquisition of certain Winterthur International insurance operations from Winterthur Swiss Insurance Company (“WSIC”) in 2001.

     The Independent Actuary's report concluded that WSIC's submitted Seasoned Net Reserve Amount (“SNRA”) and Net Premium Receivable Amount (“NPRA”) were closest tothe Independent Actuary's determinations of SNRA and NPRA. These determinations resulted in the Company receiving a net lump sum payment in the amount of approximately $575.0 million (including interest receivable) from WSIC. As the Companyhad recorded $1.4 billion in unpaid losses and loss expenses recoverable related to this protection, a loss of approximately $808.9 million, net of interest, was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005.

     3. Net adverse prior year loss development

     Net adverse prior year loss development occurs when there is an increase to loss reserves recorded at the beginning of the year, resulting from actual or reported loss development for prioryears exceeding expected loss development. The net adverse prior year loss development in 2005 related to the Company's general insurance operations most notably in the casualty and professional lines of business.

     The results for the year ended December 31, 2005 have been negatively impacted by adverse development in both the Insurance and Reinsurance segments. The following table presents the netadverse (favorable) prior year loss development of the Company's loss and loss expense reserves for its general and financial operations by each operating segment for each of the years indicated:

     During 2005, the Insurance segment's net adverse prior year development of $1.02 billion includes the results of the independent actuarial process noted above. Excluding thisdevelopment the remaining $185.8 million was driven primarily by increases in reported case reserves for excess professional liability. Strengthening of $259.5 million in professional lines was caused primarily by the establishment of casereserves on both directors' and officers' claims in pre-2002 business, and errors and omissions claims. Strengthening of $34.7 million within other specialty lines was caused primarily by increases in reported losses for specialtylines of business currently in run-off including certain Lloyd's business, discontinued programs business, and surety. A net release of $108.4 million for global risks lines of business was driven by the reduction in case reserves forpre-2002 claims primarily relating to casualty business written out of Europe.

     During 2005, net prior year reserves across the Reinsurance segment developed adversely by $93.5 million. Reserve strengthening of $266.9 million in casualty and professional lines waspartially offset by releases in other lines of business of $173.4 million. The casualty strengthening is primarily attributable to workers' compensation, umbrella liability and certain professional lines of business written in theCompany's North American operations. The reserve releases relate primarily to the property line where releases of $135.6 million occurred across all business units globally in the 2002 to 2004 underwriting years. Releases also occurred inthe marine and aviation classes of business across the reinsurance segment.

     The majority of the workers' compensation reserve increase during 2005 was related to an XL Reinsurance America Inc. (“XLRA”) working layer program written across multipleunderwriting years with a single cedent. This program was not renewed at the end of 2001. Other than this program, XLRA has not written significant working layer workers' compensation business. The remaining source of the workers'compensation reserve strengthening relates to an update of the mortality tables used in our tabular reserving methodology.

     The remainder of the strengthening in the casualty and professional lines reserves was driven by a small number of increases in reported claims in the other liability and errors and omissionslines of business in the pre-1997 underwriting years as well as recently reported claims in umbrella liability, errors and omissions and directors' and officers' lines of business in the 1997-2001 underwriting years. The professional linesclaims activity arose largely from a limited number of cedents. This reserve increase was partially offset by favorable development in the 1997- 2001 underwriting years in the medical malpractice business line. Activity in the post-2001 underwritingyears relates primarily to certain large individual claims affecting a number of lines, including surety, umbrella liability and errors and omissions.

     During 2004, the Company's net adverse prior year development of $268.0 million was a result of increases in reported insurance case reserves for excess professional liability, excesscasualty liability and specialty lines within the Insurance segment offset by net prior year releases in the Reinsurance segment. These increases in reported insurance case reserves exceeded the Company's expected losses based on historicalpatterns of loss development.

58

Strengthening of $144.0 million in professional lines was caused by a few large directors' and officers' claims in pre-2002 business, and increases in errors and omissions reserves were caused by claimsrelated to large accounting firms and to insurance/reinsurance brokers. For specialty lines, strengthening of $135.0 million was caused by reported loss increases in discontinued programs business with workers' compensation exposure,environmental related coverages, and Lloyd's as well as high severity claims on the surety book.

     During 2003, the net adverse prior period loss development related primarily to the Company's general reinsurance operations and principally to losses on business written in the 1997through 2001 underwriting years in the Company's U.S. casualty reinsurance business. In the third quarter of 2003, the Company experienced a significant increase in claims reported that was in excess of the Company's expected lossdevelopment based on historical reporting patterns and recorded an increase to reserves of $184.0 million related to this book of business. As a result of this increase, the Company began a detailed claims audit review of the cedentscontributing to this increase and the lines of business affected were primarily directors' and officers', errors and omissions, medical malpractice, commercial umbrella and general liability. Upon completion of this claims audit review,the Company increased case and IBNR reserves relating to this book of business a total of $663.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. The Company monitors actual against expected reported claims on an ongoing basis. To the extent that actualexperience on loss reserves differs significantly for this, or any other line of business, the Company would again expand its normal and ongoing cedent review program accordingly.

     See Item 8, Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and see further discussion under “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” and under“—Segments—Reinsurance” below.

     4. Growing asset base and positive performance from investments in affiliates.


     Net investment income was $1.5 billion in 2005 as compared to $1.0 billion in 2004 due primarily to a larger investment base combined with higher investment yields, as well as receiptof a distribution associated with the unwinding of a collateralized debt obligation which resulted in a one time benefit to investment income, and the accrued interest on the proceeds from the conclusion of the independent actuarial process withWSIC. The investment portfolio increased due to growth in structured and spread balances and positive operating cash flows combined with capital raising activities late in the fourth quarter. Higher investment yields were driven primarily by theimpact of increasing U.S. interest rates on cash flow and reinvested assets. In addition, net realized gains produced by the investment portfolio and the equity earnings from the Company's affiliates also contributed positively to the year. Netrealized gains on investments were $241.9 million in 2005 compared to $246.5 million in 2004. Net income from investment affiliates was $154.8 million in 2005 compared to $124.0 million in 2004. This increase was attributable to goodunderlying alternative fund returns combined with strong results from certain private equity affiliates that benefited from a series of successful liquidation events. Net income from operating affiliates (including insurance, financial andinvestment manager affiliates) was $67.4 million in 2005 compared to $147.4 million in 2004. Earnings from investment manager affiliates were strong during 2005. Earnings from operating affiliates during 2004 included $102.1 million ofincome in connection with the sales of Admiral Group Ltd and Pareto Partners L.P. and its affiliated companies. See Item 8, Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

     The following are considered to be the Company's critical accounting policies and estimates due to the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies and/or thelikelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. If actual events differ significantly from the underlying assumptions or estimates applied for any or all of the accountingpolicies (either individually or in the aggregate), there could be a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. These critical accounting policies have been discussed by management withthe Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.

     Other significant accounting policies are nevertheless important to an understanding of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Policies such as those related to revenuerecognition, financial instruments and

59

consolidation require difficult judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance. See Item 8, Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

     1) Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses and Unpaid Loss and Loss Expenses Recoverable


     As the Company earns premiums for the underwriting risks it assumes, it also establishes an estimate of the expected ultimate losses related to the premium. Loss reserves or unpaid losses andloss expenses are established due to the significant periods of time that may lapse between the occurrence, reporting and settlement of a loss. The process of establishing reserves for unpaid property and casualty claims can be complex and issubject to considerable variability as it requires the use of informed estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are based on numerous factors, and may be revised as additional experience and other data become available and arereviewed, as new or improved methodologies are developed or as current laws change. Loss reserves include:

a)     

Case reserves - reserves for reported losses and loss expenses that have not yet been settled and,

b)

Losses incurred but not reported (“IBNR”).

     At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company's total gross reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses were $23.8 billion and $19.8 billion, respectively, of which $10.6 billionand $9.8 billion related to case reserves for reported claims and $13.2 billion and $10.0 billion for IBNR reserves, respectively.

     Case reserves 

for the Company's general operations are established by management based on amounts reported from insureds or ceding companies andconsultation with legal counsel, and represent the estimated ultimate cost of events or conditions that have been reported to or specifically identified by the Company. The method of establishing case reserves for reported claims differs among theCompany's operations.

     With respect to the Company's insurance operations, the Company is notified of insured losses and records a case reserve for the estimated amount of the settlement, if any. The estimatereflects the judgment of claims personnel based on general reserving practices, the experience and knowledge of such personnel regarding the nature of the specific claim and, where appropriate, advice of legal counsel. Reserves are also establishedto provide for the estimated expense of settling claims, including legal and other fees and the general expenses of administering the claims adjustment process. With respect to the Company's reinsurance general operations, case reserves forreported claims are generally established based on reports received from ceding companies. Additional case reserves may be established by the Company to reflect the estimated ultimate cost of a loss. With respect to the Company's financialproducts and services operations, financial guaranty claims incurred on policies written on an insurance basis are established consistent with the Company's insurance operations and financial guaranty claims incurred on policies written on areinsurance basis are established consistent with the Company's reinsurance operations.

     IBNR reserves 

relate mainly to the Company's insurance and reinsurance casualty business. IBNR reserves are calculated by the Company'sactuaries using several standard actuarial methodologies including paid and incurred loss development, the Bornhuetter-Ferguson incurred loss method and frequency and severity approaches.

     IBNR reserves are calculated by the Company's actuaries using standard actuarial methodologies as discussed above. Prior to the year ended December 31, 2003, the outcomes of theCompany's actuarial reviews, consistent with historical practice, provided either (i) a single point reserve estimate or (ii) a range of reserve estimates from which the Company selected a best estimate. Since the year ended December 31, 2003,the Company adopted a methodology that provided a single point reserve estimate separately for each line of business and also a range of possible outcomes across each single point reserve estimate. This is discussed further below. As a result,reserve ranges disclosed previously are not comparable to the reserve ranges disclosed herein.

     While the proportion of unpaid loss and loss expenses represented by IBNR is sensitive to a number of factors, the most significant ones have historically been accelerating business growth andchanges in business mix. Other factors that have affected the ratio in the past include; additions to prior period reserves, catastrophic occurrences, settlement of large claims and changes in claims settlement patterns.

60

     The ratio of IBNR to total reserves has increased in recent years due to the growth of casualty business written over that period. The ratio of IBNR to total reserves is higher for more recentyears' business because these immature years have relatively fewer claims reported and, as a result, a higher proportion of claims reserves are based on experience in respect of incurred but not reported losses. As each prior year of businessmatures and claims become known, the ratio of IBNR to total reserves will typically decline, all other factors remaining constant. Since the Company has experienced rapid premium volume growth in recent years, the ratio of IBNR to total reserves hasincreased because the Company's aggregate exposure has become relatively less mature. Conversely, in a situation of declining premium volume, this ratio will typically decline, all other factors remaining constant. The Company writes insuranceand reinsurance business in many different lines. Typically, the ratio of IBNR to total reserves is greater for casualty lines (which are longer-tail in nature) than for property lines due to the policy forms utilized and timing of loss reporting.In recent years, casualty lines have increased as a proportion of the Company's business when compared to property lines (which are shorter-tail in nature).

     The single point reserve estimate is generally management's best estimate, which the Company considers to be one that has an equal likelihood of developing a redundancy or deficiency asthe loss experience matures, and this amount is recorded. The Company's actuaries utilize one set of assumptions in determining its single point estimate, which includes loss development factors, loss ratios, reported claim frequency andseverity. These reviews and documentation are completed in accordance with professional actuarial standards appropriate to the jurisdictions where the business is written. The selected assumptions reflect the actuary's judgment based onhistorical data and experience combined with information concerning current underwriting, economic, judicial, regulatory and other influences on ultimate claim settlements.

     Loss and loss expenses are charged to income as they are incurred. These charges include loss and loss expense payments and any changes in case and IBNR reserves. During the loss settlementperiod, additional facts regarding claims are reported. As these additional facts are reported, it may be necessary to increase or decrease the unpaid losses and loss expense reserves. The actual final liability may be significantly different thanprior estimates.

     The Company's net unpaid loss and loss expense general and financial reserves broken down by operating segment at December 31, 2005 and 2004 were as follows:

     With the exception of the adverse development associated with the unfavorable conclusion of the independent actuarial process, actual development of recorded reserves as of December 31, 2004during 2005 was within the estimated reserve range.

     As shown in the table above and as previously noted, the Company developed a methodology for calculating reserve ranges around its single point reserve estimates for all its lines of business.Similar to VAR (Value At Risk) models commonly used to evaluate risk, the Company modeled a statistical distribution of potential reserve outcomes over a one year run-off period. The Company used the modeled statistical distribution to calculate an80% confidence interval for the potential reserve outcomes over this one year run-off period. The high and low end points of the ranges set forth in the above table are such that there is a 10% modeled probability that the reserve will develophigher than the high point and a 10% modeled probability that the reserve will develop lower than the low point.

     The development of a reserve range models the uncertainty of the claim environment as well as the limited predictive power of past loss data. These uncertainties and limitations are notspecific to the Company. The ranges represent an estimate of the range of possible outcomes over a one year development period. A range of possible outcomes should not be confused with a range of best estimates. The range of best estimates willgenerally be much narrower than the range of possible outcomes as it will reflect reasonable actuarial and management best estimates of the expected reserve.

     Reserve volatility was analyzed for each line of business within each of the Reinsurance and Insurance segments' general operations using the Company's historical data supplemented byindustry data. These ranges were then aggregated to the lines of business shown above taking into account correlation between lines of business based on a study of the Company's historical data supplemented by industry data. The practicalresult of the correlation approach to aggregation is that the ranges by line of business disclosed above, are narrower than the sum of the ranges of the individual lines of business. Similarly, the range for the Company's total reserves in theaggregate, is narrower than the sum of the ranges for the lines of business disclosed above.

     The Company is not aware of any generally accepted model to perform the reserve range analysis described above and other models may also be employed to develop ranges.

     The Company does not calculate a range for its total net unpaid loss and loss expense reserves as it would not be appropriate to add the ranges for each line of business to obtain a rangearound the Company's total reserves, because this would not reflect the diversification effects across the Company's various lines of business. The diversification effects result from the fact that losses across the Company'sdifferent lines of business are not completely correlated.

     The Company writes both “short-tail” and “long-tail” lines of business. “Short-tail” and “long-tail” describe the time between the receipt of the premiumfrom a policy and the final settlement of any loss incurred under such policy. Short-tail lines include property catastrophe, other property and certain marine and aviation lines where, on average, the settlement period may be up to 24 months.Long-tail lines, on the other hand, include the Company's casualty business in which claims may take up to 30 years to be reported and settled. The increase in the time associated with ultimate settlement of a claim is directly related to anincrease in the amount of judgment required to establish loss reserves, especially IBNR reserves.

     See further discussion under “- Segments” below for prior year development of loss reserves.

     The Company's three types of reserve exposure with the longest tails are:

(1)     

high layer excess casualty insurance;

(2)

casualty reinsurance; and

(3)

discontinued asbestos and long-tail environmental business.

     Certain aspects of the Company's casualty operations complicate the actuarial process for establishing reserves. Certain casualty business written by the Company's insuranceoperations is high layer excess casualty business,

62

meaning that the Company's liability attaches after large deductibles including self insurance or insurance from sources other than the Company. The Company commenced writing this type of business in 1986 and issuedpolicies in forms that were different from traditional policies used by the industry at that time. Initially, there was a lack of industry data available for this type of business. Consequently, the basis for establishing loss reserves by theCompany for this type of business was largely judgmental and based upon the Company's own reported loss experience which was used as basis for determining ultimate losses, and therefore IBNR reserves. Over time, the amount of availablehistorical loss experience data has increased. As a result, the Company has obtained a larger statistical base to assist in establishing reserves for these excess casualty insurance claims.

     High layer excess casualty insurance 

claims typically involve claims relating to (i) a “shock loss” such as an explosion or transportationaccident causing severe damage to persons and/or property over a short period of time, (ii) a “non-shock” loss where a large number of claimants are exposed to injurious conditions over a longer period of time, such as exposure tochemicals or pharmaceuticals or (iii) a professional liability loss such as a medical malpractice claim. In each case, these claims are ultimately settled following extensive negotiations and legal proceedings. This process can typically take 5 to15 years following the date of loss.

     Reinsurance operations 

by their nature add further complications to the reserving process, particularly for casualty business written, in that there isan inherent lag in the timing and reporting of a loss event from an insured or ceding company to the reinsurer. This reporting lag creates an even longer period of time between the policy inception and when a claim is finally settled. As a result,more judgment is required to establish reserves for ultimate claims in the Company's reinsurance operations.

     In the Company's reinsurance general operations, case reserves for reported claims are generally established based on reports received from ceding companies. Additional case reserves maybe established by the Company to reflect the Company's estimated ultimate cost of a loss.

     Casualty reinsurance business involves reserving methods that generally include historical aggregated claim information as reported by ceding companies, combined with the results of claims andunderwriting reviews of a sample of the ceding company's claims and underwriting files. Therefore, the Company does not always receive detailed claim information for this line of business.

     Discontinued asbestos and long-tail environment business 

had been previously written by NAC Re Corp. (now known as XL Reinsurance America Inc.), prior toits acquisition by the Company.

     Except for certain workers' compensation and long-term disability liabilities, the Company does not discount its unpaid losses and loss expenses. The Company utilizes tabular reserving forworkers' compensation and long-term disability unpaid losses that are considered fixed and determinable, and discounts such losses using an interest rate of 5% at December 31, 2005 and 2004. For further discussion see the Consolidated FinancialStatements.

     Financial Guaranty Loss Reserving

     The Company is aware of the SEC's recent review of the loss reserving practices in the financial guaranty industry. The Company recognizes that there is diversity in practice amongfinancial guaranty insurers and reinsurers with respect to their accounting policies. Current accounting literature, specifically FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 60 “Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises”(“FAS 60”) and FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 97 
“Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Long-Duration Contracts and for Realized Gains and Losses fromthe Sale of Investments” 

(“FAS 97”), does not specifically address the unique characteristics of financial guaranty insurance contracts. Consequently, the accounting principles applied by theindustry have evolved over time and incorporate the concepts of both short-duration and long-duration contracts accounting under the provisions of FAS 60 and FAS 97. It is the Company's understanding that the SEC has requested that the FASBreview this matter and provide guidance for the accounting of financial guaranty insurance contracts. The Company will continue its loss reserving methodology as noted in Note 2 (k) to the Consolidated Financial

63

Statements until further guidance is provided by the SEC or the FASB. The Company had net reserves for financial guaranty insurance contracts of $173.7 million and $146.3 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004,respectively.

     Unpaid losses and loss expenses recoverable

     The recognition of unpaid losses and loss expenses recoverable requires two key judgments. The first judgment involves the Company's estimation of the amount of gross IBNR to be ceded toreinsurers. Ceded IBNR is generally developed as part of the Company's loss reserving process and consequently, its estimation is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as the estimation of gross IBNR (see “Critical Accounting Policiesand Estimates - Unpaid losses and loss expenses and unpaid loss and loss expense recoverable”). The second judgment involves the Company's estimate of the amount of the reinsurance recoverable balance that the Company will ultimatelybe unable to recover from related reinsurers due to insolvency, contractual dispute, or for other reasons. Amounts estimated to be uncollectible are reflected in a bad debt provision that reduces the reinsurance recoverable balance andshareholders' equity. Changes in the bad debt provision are reflected in net income. See “Financial Condition and Liquidity” and Item 8, Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

     As a result of the Company's acquisition of Winterthur International in July 2001, WSIC provides protection to the Company with respect to third party reinsurance receivables andrecoverables related to the Winterthur International acquisition, which are $1.6 billion in the aggregate, as of December 31, 2005. The Company has reinsurance protection under two retrocession agreements on the remaining portion of reinsurancerecoverables with respect to incurred losses seasoned as of June 30, 2004 to the extent that the Company does not receive payment of such amounts from applicable reinsurers, with one agreement providing a limit of $1.3 billion for the insurancewritten in the period to June 30, 2001, and the other agreement providing a limit of $1.3 billion for the insurance written in the period to December 31, 2000.

     2) Future Policy Benefit Reserves

     Future policy benefit reserves relate to the Company's life operations and are estimated using assumptions for investment yields, mortality, expenses and provisions for adverse lossdeviation. Uncertainties related to interest rate volatility and mortality experience make it difficult to project and value the ultimate benefit payments.

     Most of the Company's future policy benefit reserves relate to annuity portfolio reinsurance contracts under which the Company makes annuity payments throughout the term of the contractfor a specified portfolio of policies.

     For certain of these contracts, a single premium is paid at inception of the contract by way of a transfer of cash and investments to the Company.

     The reserving methodology for these annuity portfolio reinsurance contracts is described in FAS 60 as amended by FAS 97. These contracts subject the Company to risks arising from policyholdermortality over a period that extends beyond the periods in which premiums are collected. Liabilities for future policy benefit reserves are established in accordance with the provisions of FAS 60.

     Claims and expenses for individual policies within these annuity reinsurance contracts are projected over the lifetime of the contract to calculate a net present value of future cash flows.Assumptions for each element of the basis (mortality, expenses and interest) are determined at the issue of the contract and these assumptions are locked-in throughout the term of the contract unless a premium deficiency exists. The assumptions arebest estimate assumptions plus provisions for adverse deviations on the key risk elements (i.e., mortality and interest). Provisions for adverse deviation are designed to cover reasonable deviations from the best estimate outcome of the contract. Asthe experience on the contracts emerges, the assumptions are reviewed. This occurs at least annually and includes both an analysis of experience and review of likely future experience. If such review would produce reserves in excess of thosecurrently held then lock-in assumptions will be revised and a loss recognized. During the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, there were no adjustments to the locked-in assumptions for any of these contracts.

64

     The future policy benefit reserves for these annuity portfolio reinsurance contracts amounted to $5.2 billion and $3.9 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Companyholds the investment assets backing these liabilities. These investments are primarily fixed income securities with maturities that closely match the expected claims settlement profile. A 0.1% decrease in the investment yield assumption would resultin a $49 million increase in the value of future claims related to annuity portfolio reinsurance.

     As stated above, the future policy benefit reserves include provisions for adverse deviation in excess of best estimate assumptions that amounted to approximately $310 million and $145million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The future policy benefit reserves would only be increased if these provisions for adverse deviation became insufficient in the light of emerging claims experience. The present value of futureclaims would increase by approximately $18 million if mortality rates were to decrease by 1% in all future years, relative to the reserving assumptions.

     The Company also provides reinsurance of disability income protection. The future policy benefit reserves for these contracts amounted to $85 million and $86 million at December 31,2005 and 2004, respectively. Future policy benefit reserves are established in accordance with the provisions of FAS 60, including the lock-in of assumptions at inception with periodic review against experience. The liabilities relate to in-forceblocks of business, comprising underlying insurance policies that provide an income if the policyholder becomes sick or disabled. The liabilities are therefore driven mainly by the rates at which policyholders become sick (where sickness is definedby the policy conditions) and by the rates at which these policyholders recover or die. A 1% increase in the incidence rate would increase the value of future claims by approximately $0.1 million, while a 1% decrease in the termination ratewould increase the value of future claims by approximately $0.4 million.

     Following a review of morbidity experience, the locked-in assumptions were revised during the year ended December 31, 2005. The overall effect of using the revised assumptions was a reductionin income of $0.4 million.

     The Company also provides reinsurance of term assurance and critical illness policies written in the U.K. and Ireland. The future policy benefit reserves for these contracts amounted to $62million and $41 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Future policy benefit reserves are established in accordance with the provisions of FAS 60, including the lock-in of assumptions at inception with periodic review againstexperience.

     The liabilities relate to in-force blocks of business, comprising underlying insurance policies that provide mainly lump sum benefits if the policyholder dies or becomes sick. For termassurance, the liabilities are therefore driven by the rates of mortality and for critical illness cover, the liabilities are driven predominantly by the rates at which policyholders become sick (where sickness is defined by the treaty conditions),i.e., the morbidity rates. A 1% increase in the mortality rate relative to the reserving assumption would increase the value of future claims by approximately $0.6 million, and a 1% increase in the morbidity rate would increase the value offuture claims by approximately $0.6 million.

     The term assurance and critical illness treaties have been written using a variety of structures, some of which incur acquisition costs during an initial period. For such treaties, a deferredacquisition cost (“DAC”) asset has been established and an increase in future lapse rates could impact the recoverability of such costs from future premiums. The recoverability will also be influenced by the impact of lapses on futureclaims. An increase in the annual lapse rates by 1% could lead to a 5%-10% reduction in future margins available for amortizing the DAC asset.

     The Company also provided reinsurance of U.S. based term assurance, which was novated to the Company from an insurance affiliate in December 2002. The future policy benefit reserves for thesecontracts amounted to $184 million and $123 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Future policy benefit reserves are established in accordance with the provisions of FAS 60, including the lock-in of assumptions at inceptionwith periodic review against experience.

     The liabilities relate to in-force blocks of business, which are comprised of underlying insurance policies that provide mainly lump sum benefits if the policyholder dies. The liabilities aretherefore driven by the rates of mortality,

and a 1% increase in the mortality rate relative to the reserving assumption would increase the value of future claims by approximately $8 million. Following a review of mortality experience, the locked-in assumptionswere revised during the year ended December 31, 2005. The overall affect of using the revised assumptions was a reduction in income of $63 million. See Item 8, Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

     3) Deposit Liabilities

     The Company's deposit liabilities at December 31, 2005 reflect obligations assumed under funding agreements, municipal guaranteed reinvestment contracts, payment undertaking agreements andcertain structured insurance and reinsurance agreements. For each of these contracts, the Company establishes a deposit liability equal to the net cash received at inception. Each deposit liability accrues at a rate equal to the internal rate ofreturn of the payment receipts and obligations due during the life of the agreement. Where the timing and/or amount of future payments are uncertain, cash flows reflecting the Company's actuarially determined best estimates are utilized. Theultimate size of underlying losses, the impact of the contractual limits upon settlement of such losses, and the impact of the underlying loss settlement process on the timing of payments are considered as appropriate. Where uncertainty is present,an increase in the ultimate claims cost or accelerated claims settlement would potentially lead to an increase in the deposit liability accretion rate or lead to incurred losses if significant. The interest expense reported due to the accretion ofdeposit liabilities associated with structured insurance and reinsurance contracts was $49.8 million, $59.4 million and $92.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. For some of the Company'sdeposit liabilities, the accretion rate is recorded at its contractual maximum level. For all other contracts, a 1% increase in the average accretion rate would result in an increase in deposit liabilities and interest expense by $16.3 millionon an annualized basis. See Item 8, Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

     4) Derivative Instruments

     The Company conducts activities in three main types of derivative instruments: credit derivatives, weather and energy derivatives and investment-related derivative instruments. The estimate offair value for credit derivatives and weather and energy derivatives requires management's judgment. These two activities are discussed below:

     a) Credit Derivatives

     The Company enters into credit derivatives in connection with its financial guaranty business and the Company intends to hold these contracts to maturity. In determining fair value, managementdifferentiates between investment and non-investment grade exposures and models them separately. Management estimates fair value for investment grade exposures by monitoring changes in credit quality and selecting appropriate market indices todetermine credit spread movements over the life of the contracts. The determination of the credit spread movements is the basis for calculating the fair value. For credit derivatives that are non-investment grade and therefore do not have a readilydeterminable market value, the Company uses an alternative fair value methodology. The fair value is determined using a cash flow model developed by the Company and is dependent upon a number of factors, including changes in interest rates, futuredefault rates, credit spreads, changes in credit quality, future expected recovery rates and other market factors. Installment premiums are also considered in the determination of discounted net cash flows. Other elements of the change in fair valueare based upon pricing established at the inception of the contract. Changes in fair value are unrealized as the credit derivatives are not traded to realize this value. See Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About MarketRisk” for sensitivity analysis and Item 8, Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

     b) Weather and Energy Derivatives

     The fair value of weather and energy derivatives is determined through the use of quoted market prices where available. Where quoted market prices are unavailable, the fair value is estimatedusing available market data and internal pricing models using consistent statistical methodologies. Estimating fair value of instruments that do not

66

have quoted market prices requires management's judgment in determining amounts that could reasonably be expected to be received from, or paid to, a third party in settlement of the contracts. The amounts could bematerially different from the amounts that might be realized in an actual sale transaction. Fair values are subject to change in the near-term and reflect management's best estimate based on various factors including, but not limited to, actualand forecasted weather conditions, changes in commodity prices, changes in interest rates and other market factors. See Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” for sensitivity analysis and Item 8, Note 14 tothe Consolidated Financial Statements.

     5) Other Than Temporary Declines in Investments

     The Company's process for identifying declines in the fair value of investments that are other than temporary involves consideration of several factors. These factors include (i) the timeperiod during which there has been a significant decline in value, (ii) an analysis of the liquidity, business prospects and financial condition of the issuer, (iii) the significance of the decline, (iv) an analysis of the collateral structure andother credit support, as applicable, of the securities in question and (v) the Company's intent and ability to hold the investment for a sufficient period of time for the value to recover. Where the Company's analysis of the above factorsresults in the Company's conclusion that declines in fair values are other than temporary, the cost of the security is written down to fair value and the previously unrealized loss is therefore realized in the period such determination ismade.

     With respect to securities where the decline in value is determined to be temporary and the security's value is not written down, a subsequent decision may be made to sell that securityand realize a loss. Subsequent decisions on security sales are made within the context of overall risk monitoring, changing information, market conditions generally and assessing value relative to other comparable securities. Day-to-day managementof the Company's investment portfolio is outsourced to third party investment managers. While these investment managers may, at a given point in time, believe that the preferred course of action is to hold securities with unrealized losses thatare considered temporary until such losses are recovered, the dynamic nature of the portfolio management may result in a subsequent decision to sell the security and realize the loss, based upon a change in market and other factors described above.The Company believes that subsequent decisions to sell such securities are consistent with the classification of the Company's portfolio as available for sale.

     As mentioned above, the Company considers its intent and ability to hold a security until the value recovers as part of the process of evaluating whether a security's unrealized lossrepresents an other than temporary decline. However, this factor on its own does not dictate whether or not the Company recognizes an impairment charge. The Company believes its ability to hold such securities is supported by positive and sufficientcash flow from its operations and from maturities within its investment portfolio in order to meet its claims payment obligations arising from its underwriting operations without selling such investments. In this regard, cash flow from operatingactivities was $4.2 billion and $4.4 billion in 2005 and 2004, respectively.

     There are risks and uncertainties associated with determining whether declines in the fair value of investments are other than temporary. These include subsequent significant changes in generaleconomic conditions as well as specific business conditions affecting particular issuers, subjective assessment of issue-specific factors (seniority of claims, collateral value, etc.), future financial market effects, stability of foreigngovernments and economies, future rating agency actions and significant disclosure of accounting, fraud or corporate governance issues that may adversely affect certain investments. In addition, significant assumptions and management judgment areinvolved in determining if the decline is other than temporary. If management determines that a decline in fair value is temporary, then a security's value is not written down at that time. However, there are potential effects upon theCompany's future earnings and financial position should management later conclude that some of the current declines in the fair value of the investments are other than temporary declines. See “- Investment Activities - Unrealizedlosses on investments” for further information.

     6) Income Taxes

     The Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between thecarrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The Company has capitalized net operating tax losses of $238.1 million and $230.6 million against which a valuationallowance of $154.5 million and $68.6 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, has been established. The Company has capitalized realized and unrealized capital losses of $19.7 million and $7.7 million, respectively,against which a valuation allowance of $23.7 million at December 31, 2005 has been established. The deferral of benefits from tax losses is evaluated based upon management's estimates of the future profitability of the Company'staxable entities based on current forecasts, the character of income and the period for which losses may be carried forward. A valuation allowance may have to be established for any portion of a deferred tax asset that management believes will notbe realized. Should the future income of these entities fall below expectations, a further valuation allowance would have to be established, which could be significant. In addition, if any further losses are generated by these entities, these lossesmay not be tax affected.

     Effective as of January 1, 2004, XL Re America Inc (“XLRA”), a subsidiary of the Company, entered into an adverse development reinsurance treaty with another reinsurance subsidiary ofthe Company. The treaty related to the 1985 through (and including) 2000 underwriting years covering any adverse development on reserves calculated as of December 31, 2003 between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2005. The treaty has a limit of$500 million and limited loss development at XLRA relating to these underwriting years through December 31, 2005. Any commutation of this treaty requires the prior approval of the New York Department of Insurance. There is no impact of thistreaty on the consolidated financial statements of the Company; however, as part of management's continuing evaluation of its deferred tax asset, the treaty is critical in evaluating the future income position of the U.S. group of companies.Management believes that the treaty will protect the U.S. group from unexpected prior loss development. Absent unexpected loss development from the 2000 and prior underwriting years, management has concluded that there is sufficient positiveevidence of future profitability in the U.S. and that a valuation allowance as a charge against the deferred tax asset is not required at this time.

     For further information see “- Other Revenues and Expenses” and Item 8, Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

     7) Intangible Assets

     Intangible assets are carried at or below estimated fair value. There are many assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculation. Principally, the Company identifies the businessentity that the intangible asset is attributed to, and reviews historical and forecasted performance and other underlying factors affecting such analysis, including market conditions, premium rates and loss trends. Other assumptions used couldproduce a significantly different result which may result in a change in the value of the intangible asset and related amortization charge in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Based on the current expectations of profitability, an impairmentcharge would only be recognized in the event of a significant decline in the expected profitability of those operations where such intangible assets are applicable. At December 31, 2005, intangible assets were $1.8 billion of which approximately$1.4 billion and $0.4 billion related to the Company's reinsurance and insurance segments, respectively. See “ Other Revenue and Expenses” for further information.

     8) Variable Interest Entities

     The Company utilizes variable interest entities both directly and indirectly in the ordinary course of business. The Company must assess consolidation of variable interest entities based onwhether the Company is the primary beneficiary of the entity. The company that absorbs a majority of the expected losses or residual rewards of the entity is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and is therefore required to consolidate the entity.The determination of expected losses and expected residual returns requires the Company to estimate the expected cash flows of the entities

68

and measure the expected variability of these cash flows. The use of different assumptions to determine the expected cash flows and variability could affect the Company's determination of the primary beneficiary. Theassumptions used to determine the expected cash flows depend on the type of structure and the nature of the Company's variable interest. The Company has made assumptions primarily regarding default rates, the timing of defaults and recoveryrates to estimate these expected cash flows of the variable interest entities that it utilizes.

     9) Reinsurance Premium Estimates

     The Company writes business on both an excess of loss and proportional basis. In the case of excess of loss contracts, the subject written premium is generally outlined within the treaty andthe Company receives a minimum and/or deposit premium on a quarterly basis which is normally followed by an adjustment premium based on the ultimate subject premium for the contract. The Company estimates the premium written on the basis of theexpected subject premium and regularly reviews this against actual quarterly statements to revise the estimate based on the information provided by the cedent.

     On proportional contracts, written premiums are estimated to expected ultimate premiums based on information provided by the ceding companies. An estimate of premium is recorded at theinception of the contract. When the actual premium is reported by the ceding company, normally on a quarterly basis, it may be materially higher or lower than the estimate. Adjustments arising from the reporting of actual premium by the cedingcompanies are recorded in the period in which they are determined.

     Written premiums on excess of loss contracts are earned in accordance with the loss occurring period defined within the treaty, normally 12 months following inception of the contract. Writtenpremiums on proportional contracts are earned over the risk periods of the underlying policies issued and renewed, normally 24 months. For both excess of loss and proportional contracts, the earned premium is recognized ratably over the earningperiod, namely 12 - 24 months. The portion of the premium related to the unexpired portion of the policy at the end of any reporting period is reflected in unearned premiums.

     Reinsurance operations by their nature add further complications in that generally the ultimate premium due under a specific contract will not be known at the time the contract is entered into.As a result, more judgment and ongoing monitoring is required to establish premiums written and earned in the Company's reinsurance operations.

     Reinstatement premiums are recognized at the time a loss event occurs where coverage limits for the remaining life of the contract are reinstated under pre-defined contract terms and are fullyearned when recognized. Accrual of reinstatement premiums is based on the Company's estimate of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, which involves management judgment as described below.

Segments

     The Company operates through three business segments: Insurance, Reinsurance and Financial Products and Services. These business segments were determined in accordance with FAS No. 131,
“Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information”.


     The Company's segment results have been significantly impacted by the catastrophe loss events of 2005 and 2004, as noted above. These should be considered when making period to periodcomparisons of segment results.

     Following changes in certain executive management responsibilities in January 2005, the Company changed the reporting segments under which certain business units are reported in order toreflect these changes in responsibilities.

     The following areas have been changed for all periods presented:

Results of business structured by XL Financial SolutionsLtd (“XLFS”) are now included entirely within
 theFinancial Products and Services segment whereas previously this unit was  reportedin all three segments, depending on the natureof individual contracts.

69

Certain blocks of U.S.-based term life mortality reinsurancebusiness previously included in the Financial
 Productsand Services segment are now included in the Reinsurance segment as  managementof these contracts was transferred to the lifereinsurance business units in order to centralize the Company's managementof traditional mortality-based  reinsurance business.Political risk insurance business units now report to executive management of the Financial Products and
 Services segment and, as such, future earnings from this business will no longer bereported in the
 Insurance segment but included with financial operations.All operations of business units within the Financial Products and Services segment, including guaranteed
 investment contracts and funding agreements, are now reported under financialoperations in order to consolidate businesses with similar operating characteristics and risks.All net investment income and net income from affiliates generated by assets and interest expense incurred
 on liabilities of the business units within the Financial Products and Servicessegment is reported under
 financial operations. This income and expense is included in financial operations as it relates to interest on
 portfolios of separately identified andmanaged assets and deposit liabilities. Management believes this
 change will better reflect the nature of spread focused business.

     In addition, the Company has changed its presentation of certain credit derivatives and now records premiums received from sales of these derivatives in gross written premiums and establishesunearned premium reserves and loss reserves for its investment grade credit derivative business. Previously, all components of the Company's consolidated statements of income impact related to credit default swaps had been reported on one line,“Net Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Derivative Instruments.” Prior periods have been re-presented for consistency in presentation.

     The Company's business is conducted on a global basis where several of its subsidiaries operate in foreign currencies which are the base currency of that entity. Under U.S. GAAP, revenuesand expenses of those operations are translated into the U.S. dollar at average exchange rates during the year and assets and liabilities at exchange rates at the end of the year.

     Gross and net premiums written decreased by 2.3% and 3.4%, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2005 compared with the year ended December 31, 2004. These decreases were primarily dueto continued competitive pricing across most lines, most notably property. Decreases were partially offset by continued growth in the

70

newer select and design professional and U.S. primary casualty units, and the impact of foreign exchange movements on premiums. Net premiums written declined in line with gross premiums written combined with increased cededreinstatement premiums payable as a result of the catastrophe activity in the year.

     Increases in gross and net premiums written in 2004 as compared to 2003 were primarily due to new business in the casualty and professional lines, multi-year contracts written in the year andfavorable foreign exchange movements. The most significant growth was due to new business product offerings in the areas of primary casualty, specialty professional and property catastrophe risks. Partially offsetting the growth in gross and netpremiums written in 2004 were rate reductions in most property and professional lines as well as growing rate pressures on most casualty lines during 2004.

     Net premiums earned increased by 1.2% in 2005 compared with 2004. Growth in net premiums earned is primarily as a result of the earn-out of net premiums written in 2004, including the newerbusiness initiatives mentioned above and increased net retentions. This growth was partially offset by the decreased volume in 2005, noted above, and net $89.1 million ceded reinstatement premiums as a result of the natural catastrophes in2005.

     Net premiums earned increased in each of the two years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 due to the increases in net premiums written in each year, as noted above. Growth in net premiums earnedin 2004 and 2003 were partially offset by several non-renewed portfolios as the earned premium impact of the non-renewed business lags behind the written premium impact.

     Fee income and other decreased in 2005 compared to 2004 and increased in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to the income recorded on the sale of property in London in 2004, combined withfees generated by the Company's professional lines start up businesses for administration of third party portfolios.

     Exchange gains are primarily generated by movement in foreign exchange rates applied to loss reserves held in currencies other than the functional currency of the reporting subsidiary. The gainin 2003 was partially reduced by a hedge put in place by the Company in February 2003 to cover part of its exposure to a U.K. sterling reinsurance recoverable balance.

     The decreases in the underwriting profit in 2005 as compared with 2004 and the decreases in 2004 as compared with 2003 were also reflective of the combined ratios, as shown below. The followingtable presents the ratios for the Insurance segment for each of the last three years ended December 31:

      The loss and loss expense ratio includes net losses incurred for both the current year and any adverse or favorable prior year development of loss and loss reserves held at the beginning of theyear.

     The loss and loss expense ratio for the Insurance segment for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased compared with the year ended December 31, 2004, primarily reflecting the net losses of$947.0 million incurred in the property catastrophe and property lines of business as a result of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma and the Other Cats combined with the impact of overall continued softening market conditions in 2005, losses of$834.2 million representing the unfavorable outcome of the independent actuarial process with WSIC and $185.8 million in net adverse prior year development.

     The loss and loss expense ratio for the Insurance segment for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased compared with the year ended December 31, 2003 primarily due to net hurricane losses of$298.3 million in the property and marine lines, combined with prior year reserve strengthening as discussed below, and losses and loss

71

expenses related to the South Asia Tsunami. Losses due to Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne combined with the South Asia Tsunami increased the loss ratio for the year by 7.5% .

      The Company did not change its methodology or key assumptions used in 2005, 2004 or 2003 to determine ultimate loss reserves for any line of insurance business written.

     Included in net adverse prior year development is the loss associated with the independent actuarial process with WSIC. The Independent Actuary's report concluded that WSIC'ssubmitted SNRA and NPRA were closest to the Independent Actuary's determinations of SNRA and NPRA. These determinations resulted in the Company receiving a net lump sum payment in the amount of approximately $575.0 million (includinginterest receivable) from WSIC. As the Company had recorded $1.4 billion in unpaid losses and loss expenses recoverable related to this protection, incurred losses of approximately $834.2 million were recorded in the fourth quarter of2005.

     During 2005, the Insurance segment's net adverse prior year development, excluding the impact of the result of the independent actuarial process, of $185.8 million was driven primarilyby increases in reported case reserves for excess professional liability. Strengthening of $259.5 million in professional lines was caused primarily by the establishment of case reserves on both directors' and officers' claims inpre-2002 business, and errors and omissions claims. Strengthening of $34.7 million within other specialty lines was caused primarily by increases in reported losses for specialty lines of business currently in run-off including certainLloyd's business, discontinued programs business, and surety. A net release of $112.5 million for global risk lines of business was driven by the reduction in case reserves for pre-2002 claims primarily relating to casualty business writtenout of Europe.

     During 2004, the segment's net adverse development of $292.0 million was driven primarily by increases in reported case reserves for excess professional liability, excess casualtyliability and specialty lines. These increases in reported case reserves exceeded the Company's expected losses based on historical patterns of loss development. Strengthening of $144.0 million in professional lines was caused by a fewlarge directors' and officers' claims in pre-2002 business, while increases in errors and omissions reserves were caused by loss related to large accounting firms and insurance and reinsurance brokers. For specialty lines, strengthening of$135.0 million was caused by reported loss increases in discontinued programs business with workers' compensation exposure, environmental related coverages, certain Lloyd's business and high severity claims on the suretybook.

72

     During 2004 and 2003, the Company's net adverse development of its gross reserves greatly exceeded its net reserve adverse development due principally to an increase in prior year reservesrelated to Winterthur International. The Company had protection with respect to any adverse loss or premium development related to the acquired Winterthur International insurance operations with effect from July 1, 2001, under the SPA with WSIC, andrecorded a recoverable of the same amount.

     There is no assurance that conditions and trends that have affected the development of liabilities in the past will continue. Accordingly, it is not appropriate to extrapolate futureredundancies or deficiencies based on the Company's historical results.

     The underwriting expense ratio for the year ended December 31, 2005 decreased compared with the same period in 2004 as a result of a decrease in the operating expense ratio of 0.5 points (12.6%as compared to 13.1%) combined with a decrease in the acquisition expense ratio of 0.8 points (12.4% as compared to 13.2%) . The reduction in the operating expense ratio was due to productivity expense management initiatives and certain compensationcost adjustments. The reduction in the acquisition expense ratio was due primarily to a change in the commission structure with certain brokers, partially offset by the impact of ceded reinstatement premiums.

     The underwriting expense ratio for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the same period in 2003 increased slightly. The decrease in the acquisition expense ratio of 1.6 points (13.3% ascompared to 14.9%) was offset by an increase in the operating expense ratio of 1.8 points (13.1% as compared to 11.3%) . The reduction in the acquisition expense ratio was due primarily to a change in the mix of business earned compared to the sameperiod in the prior year and changes in the commission structure with certain brokers. The increase in the operating expense ratio was due primarily to the increased costs associated with supporting new business growth in the segment operationsglobally, including start up operations, an allocation of certain corporate expenses to the Insurance segment and the impact of foreign exchange movements.

     Gross and net premiums written decreased by 1.3% and 3.4%, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Selective underwriting, ratereductions across most lines, and increased retentions by ceding companies, were partially offset by new proportional Lloyd's treaties as well as significant written and ceded reinstatement premiums related to the 2005 catastrophes. Pricereductions were most notable in casualty and professional lines. The rate improvements noted in late 2004 increased further subsequent to the 2005 Hurricane season in catastrophe exposed lines. Favorable foreign exchange movements also partiallyoffset the decrease in gross premiums written. Net premiums written reflect the above gross changes.

73

     Gross premiums written increased slightly for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to 2003. Most lines of business remained relatively flat as a result of rate decreases being offset byselective new premium volume growth. Casualty rates have remained stronger than the shorter tail lines of business. The high frequency of catastrophic events prompted some stabilization of rates in the property catastrophe business most impacted bythe losses, namely in Florida, in the latter half of the year. In addition, the increasingly competitive market has resulted in the non-renewal of certain Latin American property programs. Favorable foreign exchange movements also contributed$107.3 million to the growth in gross premiums written. Net premiums written reflect the above gross changes, together with higher retentions, offset by the effects of retrocessional reinstatement premiums and growth in certain largeproportional programs that are largely retroceded.

     Net premiums earned in the year ended December 31, 2005 decreased 5.5% compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, due primarily to the earn-out of the impact of rate pressures seen in grosspremiums.

     Net premiums earned in 2004 increased 18.4% as compared to 2003 due primarily to the earning of net written premium growth over the last several years, most notably in casualty and professionallines of business. Net premiums earned for casualty and professional reinsurance lines combined were $1.2 billion in 2004 as compared to $971.2 million in 2003.

      The loss and loss expense ratio includes net losses incurred for both the current year and any adverse or favorable prior year development of loss reserves held at the beginning of theyear.

     The increase in the loss and loss expense ratio in the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the same period in 2004, primarily reflected the effects of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilmacombined with the Other Cats from which the Reinsurance segment incurred a combined $977.9 million of net losses. These natural catastrophes added 34.4% to the segment loss ratio for the year ended December 31, 2005. In addition, there washigher than expected adverse prior year development of $93.5 million relating to primarily U.S. casualty business partially offset by reserve releases in short tail lines, as discussed further below.

     The decrease in the loss and loss expense ratio for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the same period in 2003 was primarily due to the fact that 2003 included significant adverseprior period development related to the Company's North American casualty business. See further discussion below. The Reinsurance segment experienced losses in 2004 resulting from Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne, from which thesegment incurred a combined $268.3 million of net losses and loss expenses. In addition, the segment incurred net losses and loss expenses of $24.6 million as a result of the earthquake and tsunami in South Asia. These large catastrophelosses contributed 10.0% to the segment loss ratio for the year ended December 31, 2004. Catastrophe losses were partially offset by lower than expected incurred loss development in the year relating to shorter tail lines prior underwriting yearsand price improvements on earned premiums from prior periods.

      During 2005, the Insurance segment's net adverse prior year development of $1.02 billion includes the results of the independent actuarial process noted above. Excluding thisdevelopment the remaining $185.8 million was driven primarily by increases in reported case reserves for excess professional liability. Strengthening of $259.5 million in professional lines was caused primarily by the establishment of casereserves on both directors' and officers' claims in pre-2002 business, and errors and omissions claims. Strengthening of $34.7 million within other specialty lines was caused primarily by increases in reported losses for specialtylines of business currently in run-off including certain Lloyd's business, discontinued programs business, and surety. A net release of $108.4 million for global risks lines of business was driven by the reduction in case reserves forpre-2002 claims primarily relating to casualty business written out of Europe.

     During 2005, net prior year reserves across the Reinsurance segment developed adversely by $93.5 million. Reserve strengthening of $266.9 million in casualty and professional lines waspartially offset by releases in other lines of business of $173.4 million. The casualty strengthening is primarily attributable to workers' compensation, umbrella liability and certain professional lines of business written in theCompany's North American operations. The reserve releases relate primarily to the property line where releases of $135.6 million occurred across all business units globally in the 2002 to 2004 underwriting years. Releases also occurred inthe marine and aviation classes of business across the reinsurance segment.

     The remainder of the strengthening in the casualty and professional lines reserves was driven by a small number of increases in reported claims in the other liability and errors and omissionslines of business in the pre-1997 underwriting years as well as recently reported claims in umbrella liability, errors and omissions and directors' and officers' lines of business in the 1997-2001 underwriting years. The professional linesclaims activity arises largely from a limited number of cedents. This reserve increase was partially offset by favorable development in the 1997- 2001 underwriting years in the medical malpractice business line. Activity in the post-2001underwriting years relates primarily to certain large individual claims affecting a number of lines, including surety, umbrella liability and errors and omissions.

     During 2004, net prior year reserves across the Reinsurance segment developed favorably by $24 million. Releases of $144 million in the property, aviation, marine and other lines ofbusiness were partially offset by strengthening of casualty and accident and health reserves amounting to approximately $122 million. Property catastrophe and property other reserve releases totaled approximately $95 million net relatedprimarily to the 2002 and 2003 underwriting years where loss experience has been exceptionally good for the property line. The strengthening of casualty reserves totaled $77 million and related most significantly to professional liabilityreserves which were strengthened by $32 million for Enron and Worldcom claims. The accident & health reserve strengthening of $45 million relates to a portfolio of business underwritten by certain of the Company'sLloyd's syndicates.

75

     During 2003, the Company increased its estimated reserves related to its reinsurance segment (excluding the September 11 event) by $996 million, of which approximately $877 millionrelated primarily to the Company's North American reinsurance operations for casualty business underwritten during the 1997 through 2001 underwriting years. The main lines of business affected by this adverse development included generalliability, medical malpractice, professional and surety lines. This adverse development was due to competitive market pressures on pricing during these underwriting years combined with an increase in the number and size of claims reported in recentyears as a result of increases in court filings, corporate scandals, rising tort costs and settlement awards. Prior year reserves also developed adversely on certain other casualty business written in the 1998 through 2001 underwriting years outsideof North America. These exposures were affected by trends similar to those as described above for the North American casualty reinsurance operations. The casualty exposures underwritten in these entities were much less than those of the NorthAmerican operations, so the impact on the prior year reserves was relatively smaller.

     In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company reduced aviation loss reserves related to the September 11 event by $197 million. This reduction in reserves was due to higher than expectedlevels of participation (97%) in the September 11 Victim Compensation Fund, a no-fault compensation scheme funded by the U.S. Government, which closed on December 22, 2003. This resulted in a reduction of the estimated ultimate losses by the Companyfor this event.

     The segment's reserving process includes a continuing evaluation of the potential impact on unpaid liabilities from exposure to asbestos and environmental claims, including related lossadjustment expenses. Liabilities are established to cover both known and incurred but not reported claims.

     A reconciliation of the opening and closing unpaid losses and loss expenses related to asbestos and environmental exposure claims related to business written prior to 1986 for the yearsindicated is as follows:

     Incurred but not reported losses, net of reinsurance, included in the above table was $16.7 million at December 31, 2005, $22.5 million at December 31, 2004 and $27.0 million atDecember 31, 2003. Unpaid losses recoverable are net of potential uncollectible amounts.

     The Company utilizes industry standard asbestos and environmental claims models to estimate its ultimate liability for these exposures.

     The Company reviews its actual reported loss experience for asbestos and environmental claims for its 1985 and prior exposures annually. The actual loss experience was consistent withassumptions established and, therefore, there was no adverse prior year development of the Company's asbestos and environmental reserves in 2004 or 2005. The reserves for these exposures represented less than 1% of the Company's totalunpaid loss and loss expense reserves at December 31, 2005.

     The Company believes it has made reasonable provision for its asbestos and environmental exposures and is unaware of any specific issues that would significantly affect its estimate for lossand loss expenses. For further information see Item 8, Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

     The decrease in the underwriting expense ratio in the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2004, was due to a decrease in both the acquisition expenseratio and operating expense

76

ratio to 21.7% and 5.6%, respectively, as compared to 22.1% and 6.5%, respectively, for the year ended 2004. The decrease in the acquisition expense ratio was mainly due to decreased profit commissions, which resulted fromthe 2005 hurricane activity. The operating expense ratio decrease primarily reflects severance costs incurred during 2004 for reduction of staff as well as productivity expense management initiatives in 2005 and adjustments to certain 2005compensation costs.

     The decrease in the underwriting expense ratio for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared with 2003 was primarily due to a decrease in acquisition cost ratio driven by reduced profitcommissions as a result of the year's catastrophic losses. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the operating expense ratio resulting from additional allocations of corporate expenses as well as the adverse impact of foreignexchange.

     Exchange losses in the year ended December 31, 2005 were mainly attributable to an overall strengthening in the value of the U.S. dollar against U.K. Sterling and the Euro in thoseoperations' unpaid losses in non-U.S. dollar currencies. Exchange gains in 2004 and 2003 were mainly attributable to a decline in the value of the U.S. dollar against U.K. sterling and the Euro in Bermuda-based operations that write businessglobally.

     Life and annuity gross and net premiums written, net premiums earned and claims and policy benefits in each of the three years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 included the assumption ofthe following long duration annuity portfolios:

     1. Second and fourth quarters of 2005 - A large U.K. immediate annuity portfolio contract bound representing $1.8 billion in net premiums earned and two smaller Irish immediate annuityportfolios amounted to $96.2 million.

     2. Second and fourth quarters of 2004 - Two large U.K. portfolio contracts, representing $995 million in net premiums earned and related claims and policy benefits.

     3. Fourth quarter of 2003 - two portfolios, one U.K. and one Irish, for a total of approximately $395.5 million in net premiums earned and related claims and policy benefits.

     The Company acquired cash and investment assets related to the future policy benefit reserves assumed at inception of these large contracts. While the Company expects to write more of thesecontracts, the frequency of these transactions will likely continue to be irregular.

77

     Excluding these large contracts, net premiums earned in life and annuity reinsurance increased in 2005 compared with 2004 and 2004 compared with 2003, as the Company expanded its life andannuity reinsurance operations in Europe, and continues to bind additional regular premium term assurance contracts which generate ongoing premiums.

     Claims and policy benefits also increased significantly in 2005 as compared to 2004, as a result of the annuity payout liabilities accepted under the contracts noted above where investmentassets were acquired with the assumption of the policy benefit reserves at the inception of the contract. In addition, $37.4 million in losses were recorded during the second quarter of 2005 related to certain novated blocks of U.S.-based termlife mortality reinsurance business as a result of the actuarially modeled impact of actual paid losses being greater than expected. In accordance with U.S. GAAP treatment for life business, a loss recognition test process was carried out todetermine if expected future premiums would be sufficient to pay for expected future losses. This process led to management's decision to unlock the current policy benefit reserve ratio and record a loss.

     Acquisition costs increased in the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 reflecting the write-off of certain deferred costs of $25.9 million,including value of business assumed related to the U.S. mortality business noted above, as current profit projections did not support the recovery of the deferred costs booked in the prior year. Operating expenses increased in 2005 compared to 2004due to build-out of existing operations and start-up costs of new life operations in the U.S.

     Net investment income has increased reflecting the increase in life business invested assets primarily arising from new large annuity contracts written since 2004. Net investment income isincluded in the calculation of net income from life and annuity operations as it relates to income earned on portfolios of separately identified and managed life investment assets and other allocated assets. The accretion of the related futurepolicy benefit reserves is included in claims and policy benefits.

     Increases in gross and net premiums written of 9.5% in 2005, as compared to 2004, were primarily due to additional premiums due in 2005 on a structured property and casualty policy, whichincurred a loss related to Hurricane Katrina, as well as premiums from several new structured property and casualty policies written during the year. Financial guaranty premiums remained relatively flat in 2005, as compared to 2004.

     Decreases in gross and net premiums written of 4.2% and 7.2%, respectively, in 2004, as compared to 2003, were primarily due to lower financial guaranty premiums written, resulting frommanagement's underwriting and pricing discipline during generally weaker market conditions in 2004. In addition, during 2004 there were fewer large up-front premium contracts written, as compared with the prior year. Financial guaranty marketconditions in 2004, as compared to 2003 were characterized by tighter credit spread compression, higher interest rates, increased competition and reduced public financing volume.

     Financial guaranty up-front premiums are earned over the life of the insured debt obligations based on par amount of risk outstanding. Financial guaranty installment premiums are earned overthe installment period. Premiums from structured property and casualty and political risk business are generally earned over the period of coverage.

     The following table provides a line of business breakdown of the Financial Products and Services segment's net premiums earned:

     The increase in net premiums earned of 11.0% during 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily resulted from additional premiums due in 2005 on a structured property and casualty policy whichincurred a loss related to Hurricane Katrina, as well as new structured property and casualty business production in 2005, offset in part by lower earned premium in our financial guaranty line of business in 2005, as compared to 2004. The yearover year decrease in earnings in our financial guaranty line of business was primarily attributable to $23.3 million of premium earnings recorded in 2004 relating to an insured project financing on which a full-limit loss was recognized duringthe year (for further discussion see “Net losses and loss expenses” below).

     The increase in net premiums earned in 2004, as compared to the prior year, was primarily due to growth in the financial guaranty in force book of business, in conjunction with the accelerationof $23.3 million in premium earnings on the insured project financing discussed above (for further discussion see “Net losses and loss expenses” below). This increase was partially offset by the impact on earned premiums in 2003related to the refunding of certain insured financings and certain short term contract enhancements.

     Net losses and loss expenses include current year net losses incurred and adverse or favorable development of prior year reserves for net losses and loss expenses. Net losses and loss expensesduring 2005 decreased by 7.5%, as compared to 2004. This decrease primarily resulted from lower incurred losses in the Company's financial guaranty business of approximately $65.8 million due primarily to the absence of significantindividual losses as compared to the prior year, as well as favorable development associated with the Company's unallocated loss reserves, partially offset by an increase in loss reserves in our structured property and casualty business ofapproximately $50.4 million that primarily resulted from a limit loss incurred under a contract related to Hurricane Katrina.

     Net losses and loss expenses in 2004 increased by 14.1% compared to 2003. The increase was primarily the result of a provision for losses in 2004 of approximately $41.7 million relating tothe subordinate layer of an insured

79

project financing structure, as well as a net increase in unallocated reserves resulting from the growth in financial guaranty in force business, offset by a decrease in reserves in 2004, as compared to 2003, relating tonon-investment grade credit default swaps of approximately $37.4 million.

     For 2005, acquisition costs decreased by approximately $0.4 million. This decrease consisted of higher acquisition expenses in our guaranteed investment contract and funding agreementbusinesses, offset by lower acquisition expenses in our financial guaranty business. Lower acquisition expenses in our financial guaranty business were primarily the result of ceding proportionally more installment business relative to upfrontbusiness in 2005, as compared to 2004. Risk on installment business generally expires faster than that on upfront business, which resulted in a higher year over year amortization of deferred commissions. For 2004 acquisition costs decreased comparedwith 2003 reflecting a change in the average life of the financial guaranty in force book of business over which such costs are expensed.

     For 2005, net operating expenses, including non-structured and structured products, were $113.6 million, a decrease of $6.6 million from $120.2 million in 2004. The favorablemovement was mostly attributable to a reduction in compensation expense and professional fees. For 2004, net operating expenses, including non-structured and structured products, increased by $32.2 million to $120.2 million from $88.0million for 2003 due primarily to the investment in segment infrastructure and continued build-out of the financial products platform as well as an increase in the allocation of certain corporate expenses.

     Net investment income related to the financial guaranty business increased by 76.0% in 2005, as compared to 2004, due primarily to higher average invested assets resulting from net cash inflowsfrom operations and a $125.0 million capital infusion during the fourth quarter of 2004. In addition, $16.3 million in investment income (including a special one-time dividend paid in 2005 of $9.9 million) relates to the Company'sinvestment in Financial Security Assurance International Ltd. (“FSAI”). The special dividend was paid in connection with the redemption of the Company's investment in FSAI during December of 2005. Prior to October 1, 2004, thisinvestment in FSAI was accounted for under the equity method and reported the associated results thereof in “Net income from financial and investment affiliates”. Effective October 1, 2004, the Company changed the accounting for itsinvestment in FSAI from the equity method to FSAB 115, 
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities 

to conform to the requirements of EITF 02-14
Whether an Investor Should Apply the Equity Method of Accounting to Investments Other Than Common Stock 

(“EITF 02-14”). Accordingly, beginning October 1, 2004 theonly earnings recognized by the Company on its investment in FSAI were dividends that were reported in investment income.

     Net investment income related to the financial guaranty business increased by 75.2% in 2004, as compared to 2003, due primarily to higher average invested assets resulting from net cash inflowsfrom operations and a $100.0 million capital infusion to this business in the fourth quarter of 2003.

     Net investment income related to structured products increased by 80.2% in 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily as a result of a significant increase in average funding agreement and guaranteedinvestment contract deposits from $2.8 billion in 2004 to $4.9 billion in 2005. Similarly, net investment income related to structured products increased 55.7% in 2004, as compared to 2003, due to an increase in average funding agreement andguaranteed investment contract deposits from $1.1 billion in 2003 to $2.8 billion in 2004.

     Interest expense on structured products relates to deposit liabilities associated with funding agreements, guaranteed investment contracts and certain structured property and casualtycontracts. The increase in interest expense during 2005, as compared to 2004, related primarily to the increase in the average funding agreement and guaranteed investment contract deposits in 2005 discussed above, partially offset by reducedinterest expense on certain structured property and casualty contracts resulting from a change in the timing of estimated future cash outflows from such contracts during 2005.

     Net income from financial affiliates includes earnings on the Company's investment in Primus Guaranty, Ltd (“Primus”) and certain of the Company's investment affiliates,which are accounted for under the equity method. The decrease in such earnings in 2005, as compared to 2004, was due primarily to a decrease in earnings from Primus, as

80

well as the change in accounting related to the Company's investment in FSAI to conform with the requirements of EITF 02-14 as discussed above. Primus specializes in providing credit risk protection through creditderivatives. Net income from financial affiliates also decreased in 2004, as compared to 2003, due primarily to the Company's investment in Primus. Primus had a mark-to-market adjustment in 2004, which was less favorable than that recorded in2003. This decrease was partially offset by income from the sale of a portion of the Company's investment in Primus, in connection with the initial public offering of Primus in the fourth quarter of 2004.

     Minority interest in 2005 is consistent with 2004. The decrease in minority interest in 2004, as compared to 2003, reflects the fact that the minority interest holder's return oninvestment is contractually capped. The minority interest relates to an equity position in XL Financial Assurance Ltd., which is held by a third party.

     Net results from structured derivatives represent changes in the market value of the segment's insured credit derivative portfolio, as well as results from its weather and energyderivative business and certain structured financial risk management products. Net results from structured derivatives decreased 8.2% in 2005, as compared to 2004. Results in 2005 primarily consist of (i) $8.2 million of unrealized gainsresulting from the reclassification to “net losses and loss expenses” of an incurred loss on a credit default swap, (ii) an $18.6 million gain on the settlement of a structured market risk management derivative product tied to ahousing price index, and (iii) $17.8 million net realized and unrealized gains in the weather and energy business. Results in 2004 primarily consist of (i) net unrealized gains on the credit derivative portfolio of $44.2 million resultingprimarily from tightening credit spreads during the year, (ii) $3.3 million of net realized and unrealized gains on the structured financial derivative business, and (iii) $2.0 million of net realized and unrealized gains in the weather andenergy business.

For a summary of realized and unrealized gains and losses on all derivative instruments, see Item 8, Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

     Net investment income related to general operations increased in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to growth in the investment base, as well as increases in the yield of the portfolio. Thegrowth in the investment base reflected the Company's cash flow from operations. The Company also received a distribution associated with the unwinding of a collateral debt obligation, which resulted in a one-time benefit to investment income.In addition, the Company received investment income of $25.3 million on related to the conclusion of the independent actuarial process with WSIC.

     The Company's total investments available for sale and cash and cash equivalents less net pending payable for investments purchased was $38.8 billion at December 31, 2005 as comparedto $29.8 billion at December 31, 2004. This increase of $9.0 billion includes (i) cash flow from financing activities of $3.2 billion in the fourth quarter of

81

2005, (ii) cash flow of $2.0 billion from spread product transactions and (iii) cash flow from operations of $4.2 billion. The annualized effective yield of the total investment portfolio (excluding non-recurringitems) was 4.1% for 2005 as compared to 3.8% for 2004, a 0.3% increase. The increase in the effective yield of the total investment portfolio was primarily due to general interest rate increases in the U.S.

     It is expected that net investment income in 2006 will increase due to projected increases in investments resulting from the full year effect of investing proceeds from the December 2005capital raise, and monies received from conclusion of the independent actuarial process with WSIC, as well as anticipated increases in market yields on reinvestment of existing assets and investment of new cash flows. However, actual market changesin interest rates could offset or supplement the effects of cash flow. For a further discussion see “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

     Net income from investment affiliates includes earnings from the Company's investments in closed-end investment funds and partnerships and similar vehicles that are equity accounted. Netincome from investment affiliates increased in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to a strong result in private equity portfolios due to a series of positive liquidity events, with continued good returns on the alternative portfolios.

     Investment Performance

     The Company manages its investment grade fixed income securities using an asset/liability management framework. Due to the unique nature of the underlying liabilities, customized benchmarks areused to measure investment performance and comparison to standard market indices is not meaningful. Investment performance is not monitored for certain assets primarily consisting of operating cash and special regulatory deposits. The following is asummary of the investment portfolio returns for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 of the general account asset/liability portfolio, structured and spread product portfolio and risk asset portfolios.

Portfolio returns are calculated by dividing the sum of the net investment income or net income from investment affiliates, realized gains (losses) and unrealized gains (losses) by the average market value of eachportfolio. Non U.S. dollar fixed income performance is measured in either the underlying currency or in U.S. dollars.

Net realized gains and losses on investments and other than temporary declines in the value of investments


     The Company's investment portfolio is classified as available for sale. Realized investment gains and losses occur through the normal turnover of the Company's investment portfolio.Realized investment losses include impairment charges relating to declines in value of securities that are considered to be other than temporary. See “- Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” for further information.

     In 2005, net realized gains on investments were $241.9 million which includes $250.8 million of gross realized losses on fixed income and $54.1 million of gross realized losses onequity securities. Gross realized losses in 2005

82

included $53.2 million of provisions for declines in fair value considered to be other than temporary. In the U.S., the general level of corporate defaults was stable. For example, Moody's Investors Service, Inc.(“Moody's”) reported that 31 issuers defaulted in 2005 compared with 34 issuers in 2004 and 77 issuers in 2003. The Company's exposure to these defaults was limited in both 2005 and 2004, compared to 2003, resulting in areduction in the write-down for other than temporary declines. As a percentage of the total fixed income portfolio, the write-down for other than temporary declines was 0.1% in 2005 as compared to a negligible amount in 2004 and 0.6% in2003.

     In 2004, net realized gains on investments were $246.5 million which includes $265.9 million of gross realized losses on fixed income and $48.8 million of gross realized losses onequity securities. Gross realized losses in 2004 included $6.4 million of provisions for declines in fair value considered to be other than temporary.

     In 2003, net realized gains on investments were $120.2 million, which included $344.8 million of gross realized losses on fixed income and $162.5 million of gross realized losses onequity securities. Gross realized losses in 2003 included $130.7 million of provisions for declines in fair value considered to be other than temporary.

     With respect to those securities that were sold at a loss during the year ended December 31, 2005, the following is an analysis of the period of time that those securities had been in acontinual unrealized loss position, the amount of the realized loss recorded in the Company's results of operations as of the sale date and the amount of the impairment charge taken in the year:

      The Company's process for identifying declines in the fair value of investments that are other than temporary involves consideration of several factors, as discussed under “CriticalAccounting Policies and Estimates.”

83

     During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company realized losses of $250.8 million and $54.1 million upon the sale of fixed income securities and equity securities, respectively,that had been in an unrealized loss position for greater than twelve months. During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company realized losses of $18.9 million and $3.3 million upon the sale of fixed income securities and equitysecurities, respectively, that had been in an unrealized loss position for greater than twelve months. The decisions to sell these securities were made by the Company's investment managers based upon a change in market conditions and otherfactors (these decisions were independent of the Company's previously stated intent and ability to hold such securities).

     Net realized and unrealized gains on investment derivatives result from the Company's investment strategy to economically hedge against interest and foreign exchange risk within theinvestment portfolio. For a further discussion see Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” and “- Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

     Unrealized losses on investments

     At December 31, 2005, there were $312.7 million of gross unrealized losses on fixed income and short-term investments, and $8.8 million of gross unrealized losses on equity securities.At December 31, 2004, there were $119.7 million of gross unrealized losses on fixed-income and short-term investments, and $7.2 million of gross unrealized losses on equity securities. These losses include securities below investment grade,as discussed below.

     The information shown below about the unrealized losses on the Company's investments at December 31, 2005 and 2004, concerns the potential effect upon future earnings and financialposition should management later conclude that some of the current declines in the fair value of these investments are other than temporary declines.

      At December 31, 2005, the total gross unrealized losses represented approximately 9,100 fixed income securities out of a total of approximately 17,300 and approximately 400 equity securitiesout of a total of approximately 1,800. At December 31, 2004, the total gross unrealized losses represented approximately 5,100 fixed income securities out of a total of approximately 15,300, and approximately 200 equity securities out of a total ofapproximately 1,600.

     As discussed under Item 1, “Investments - Investment Structure and Strategy,” the Company operates a risk asset portfolio that includes high yield (below investment grade) fixedincome securities. These securities are more sensitive to credit risk than investment grade securities. At December 31, 2005, approximately 2.4% of the Company's fixed income investment portfolio was invested in securities that were belowinvestment grade or not rated. Approximately4.3% of the unrealized losses in the Company's fixed income securities portfolioat December 31, 2005, related to securities that were below investment gradeor not rated. At December 31, 2004, approximately 4.6%

of the Company's fixed income investment portfolio was invested in securities that were below investment grade or not rated. Approximately 5.8% of the unrealized losses in the Company's fixed income securitiesportfolio at December 31, 2004, related to securities that were below investment grade or not rated.

     In 2005, net income from operating affiliates declined over 2004, which resulted from the fact that the 2004 results included proceeds from the sale of two affiliates, as described below. Theresults of the Company's investment management affiliates showed good underlying growth in 2005 due to good investment performance and growth in assets managed by these minority-owned managers.

     In 2004, the increase in net income from operating affiliates included strong performance by the Company's investment management affiliates combined with income of $66.7 million on thesale of the Company's investment in the Admiral Group Ltd. and $35.4 million of income from the sale of the Company's stake in Pareto Partners L.P. and its affiliated companies, as well as strong growth in assets managed by theseminority-owned managers.

     Net income from operating affiliates in 2003 included an other than temporary decline of $40.9 million in the value of the Company's investment in Annuity and Life Reinsurance Company.The investment was written down to its fair value of $2.2 million at March 31, 2003. See Item 8, Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

     Amortization of intangible assets decreased in 2005 as a result of certain intangible assets that were fully amortized during the year. Amortization of intangible assets increased in 2004 ascompared to 2003 due primarily to the acquisition of a book of business related to XL Re Europe at the end of 2003.

     Corporate operating expenses in 2005 decreased by 10.0% primarily as a result of Company-wide cost reduction efforts combined with reduced compensation costs and partially offset by increasedlegal costs. Corporate operating expenses in 2004 increased 35.5% compared to 2003 due to the continued build-out of the Company's global infrastructure and personnel in developing its network of shared service organizations to supportoperations in certain locations, costs related to compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and adverse foreign exchange impacts.

     Interest expense includes costs related to the Company's debt and collateral facilities as well as deposit liability accretion. The increase in interest expense primarily reflected theincrease in average outstanding debt for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to 2004. For more information on the Company's financial structure, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources”.

     In 2004, interest expense has increased primarily as a result of the additional interest related to the senior notes issued in March, August and November of 2004, partially offset by thereduced interest as a result of the redemption of the Liquid Yield Option Notes and Zero Coupon Convertible Debentures during that year.

     The change in the Company's income taxes in each of the three years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 principally reflects the effects of changes in the profitability of the U.S. andEuropean operations for each year. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 decreased from 2004, due primarily to losses incurred in the Company's U.S. operations as a result of the 2005 catastrophe activity. A significantproportion of the loss reserve increases are captured in non-U.S. subsidiaries where no tax relief is available.

86

     The deferral of tax losses is evaluated based upon the future profitability of the Company's taxable entities and, under current projections, the Company anticipates using this asset. TheCompany's net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2005 was $318.4 million, which consists primarily of net operating losses generated by subsidiaries in the U.S. and U.K. Should the taxable income of these entities fall below expectations, afurther valuation allowance may have to be established, which could be significant. In addition, if any further losses are generated by these entities, these losses may not be tax effected. See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates”and Item 8, Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Approximately 2.4% was below investment gradeor not rated.

Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses

     Unpaid losses and loss expenses include reserves on the Company's general and financial operations and relates primarily to the casualty insurance and reinsurance business written by theCompany. The balance was $23.8 billion at December 31, 2005, which is an increase of $4.0 billion from December 31, 2004. The increase was due primarily to $3.8 billion in gross losses from catastrophe activity in 2005.

     While the Company reviews the adequacy of established reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses regularly, no assurance can be given that actual claims made and payments related thereto willnot be in excess of the amounts reserved. In the future, if such reserves develop adversely, such deficiency would have a negative impact on future results of operations. See Item 1, “Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses”, “CriticalAccounting Policies and Estimates” and Item 8, Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses Recoverable and Reinsurance Balances Receivable


     In the normal course of business, the Company seeks to reduce the potential amount of loss arising from claims events by reinsuring certain levels of risk assumed in various areas of exposurewith other insurers or reinsurers. While reinsurance agreements are designed to limit the Company's losses from large exposures and permit recovery of a portion of direct unpaid losses, reinsurance does not relieve the Company of its ultimateliability to the Company's insureds. Accordingly, the losses and loss expense reserves on the balance sheet represent the Company's total unpaid gross losses. Unpaid losses and loss expense recoverable relates to estimated reinsurancerecoveries on the unpaid loss and loss expense reserves.

     Unpaid losses and loss expense recoverables were $6.4 billion and $7.0 billion at December 31, 2005, and 2004, respectively. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, reinsurance balancesreceivable were $1.0 and $1.1 billion, respectively. The table below presents the Company's net reinsurance recoverable at December 31, 2005 and 2004.

     The Company has credit risk should any of its reinsurers be unable or unwilling to settle amounts due. Of the $7.5 billion total unpaid losses and loss expenses recoverable and reinsurancebalances receivable at December 31, 2005, no individual reinsurer accounted for 10% or more of the total. The Company is the beneficiary of letters of credit, trust accounts and funds withheld in the aggregate amount of $2.1 billion at December31, 2005, collateralizing reinsurance recoverables with respect to certain reinsurers. The provision for uncollectible reinsurance is required principally due to the failure of reinsurers to indemnify the Company primarily because of disputes underreinsurance contracts and insolvencies. As at December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had a reserve for potential non-recoveries from reinsurers of $260.7 million and $280.7 million, respectively.

88

     Included in unpaid loss and loss expenses recoverable at December 31, 2004, was an unsecured reinsurance recoverable from WSIC of $1.45 billion, related to certain contractual arrangementsin the SPA entered into in connection with the Company's acquisition of Winterthur International in July 2001. This balance was settled in 2005 for $575 million, resulting in a loss of $808.9 million, net of interestreceived.

     Under the terms of the SPA, WSIC provides the Company with protection with respect to third party reinsurance receivables and recoverables related to the acquisition of certain WinterthurInternational insurance operations (the “Winterthur Business”), which were approximately $1.6 billion, in the aggregate, as of December 31, 2005. There are two levels of protection for these balances:

1.     

At the time of the Winterthur International acquisition, WSIC provided to the Company a liquidity facility. At the time of the payment of the net reserve seasoned amount on December 12, 2005, the Company exercised its rightto repay up to the balances outstanding on this facility by assignment to WSIC of an equal amount of receivables relating to reinsurance recoverables selected by the Company. During December 2005, the Company assigned $265.4 million ofreceivables to WSIC under this arrangement, although WSIC has disputed the assignment of certain of these receivables.

2.

Under two retrocession agreements the Company has reinsurance protection on the reinsurance recoverables with respect to the Seasoned Net Reserves Amount determined as of June 30, 2004, to the extent that the Company doesnot receive payment of such amounts from applicable reinsurers with one agreement providing a limit of $1.3 billion for the insurance written in the period to June 30, 2001, and the other agreement providing a limit of $1.3 billion for theinsurance written in the period to December 31, 2000.

     At December 31, 2005, certain reinsurers responsible for some portions of the reinsurance of the acquired Winterthur Business have raised issues as to whether amounts claimed are due anddiscussions are currently ongoing to achieve a resolution.

     Approximately 76% of the total unpaid loss and loss expense recoverable and reinsurance balances receivable (excluding collateral held) outstanding at December 31, 2005, were due fromreinsurers rated “A” or better by S&P. The following is an analysis of the total recoverable and reinsurance balances receivable at December 31, 2005, by reinsurers owing more than 3% of such total:

 Liquidity and Capital Resources

     As a holding company, the Company's assets consist primarily of its investments in subsidiaries, and the Company's future cash flows depend upon the availability of dividends or otherstatutorily permissible payments from its subsidiaries. The ability to pay such dividends is limited by the applicable laws and regulations of the various countries in which the Company operates, including, among others, Bermuda, the United States,Ireland, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and those of the Society of Lloyd's and certain contractual provisions. See Item 8, Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. No assurance can be given that the Company orits subsidiaries will be permitted to pay dividends in the future.

Liquidity

     Certain business written by the Company has loss experience generally characterized as having low frequency and high severity. This may result in volatility in both the Company's resultsand operational cash flows.

     See Item 8 - “Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.” There are three main sources of cash flows for the Company - those provided by operations, investing activities andfinancing activities.

      Cash Flow provided by Operations


     Cash flow from operations is derived from two main sources:

1)     

The receipt of investment income on the Company's total investment portfolio; and

2)

The net receipt of premiums less claims and expenses related to its underwriting activities in general, life and annuity and financial operations.

     Cash flow from operations was $4.2 billion in 2005, as compared to $4.4 billion in 2004. The decrease in 2005 is due primarily to cash payments on catastrophe losses during 2005,partially offset by the receipt of a net lump sum payment of $575.0 million from WSIC, related to the conclusion of the independent actuarial process and an increase in the receipt of investment income in line with increasing interest rates andthe growth of the investment portfolio.

     Net cash received from underwriting activities is comprised of receipt of premiums, minus payment of claims and operating and acquisition costs. Premiums and acquisition expenses are settledbased on terms of trade as stipulated by an underwriting contract, and generally are received within the first year of inception of a policy when the premium is written, but can be up to three years on certain reinsurance business assumed. Operatingexpenses are generally paid within a year of being incurred. Claims especially for casualty business, may take a much longer time before they are reported and ultimately settled and this is why the Company establishes reserves for unpaid lossesand

90

loss expenses. Therefore, the amount of claims paid in any one year is not necessarily related to the amount of net losses incurred, as reported in the consolidated statement of income.

     During 2005, 2004 and 2003, the total amounts of net losses paid for general and financial operations were $2.6 billion, $3.1 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, whereas the amount of netlosses incurred was $7.4 billion, $4.9 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively. The decrease in net paid losses in 2005, is due to the receipt of a net lump sum payment of approximately $575 million related to the conclusion of theindependent actuarial process with WSIC, partially offset by payments on 2005 Atlantic hurricane losses. The payout of the Company's casualty reserves at December 31, 2005, could be as long as a thirty year period. Property claims are generallyreported and settled within a much shorter period, usually up to three years.

Cash Flow used in Investing Activities

     Generally, positive cash flow from operations and financing activities is invested in the Company's portfolio, including affiliates or acquisition of subsidiaries. Investing activities in2005, were primarily related to the renewal purchase and sale of portfolio investments. In 2004, in addition to purchases and sales of the Company's total investment portfolio, the Company sold its interests in Admiral Group Ltd and ParetoPartners L.P. and its affiliated companies for $66.7 million and $45.1 million, respectively.

     In 2003, in addition to purchases and sales of the Company's total investment portfolio, the Company had the following significant investment cash flows:

1)     

In September 2003, the Company exercised its option and settled the related Euro liability to purchase the remaining 33% ownership of Le Mans RÉ, now known as XL Re Europe, for approximately $161million.

See Item 8, Note 5(a) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

2)

In December 2003, the Company received $75.4 million relating to the agreement reached with WSIC as to the final purchase price for Winterthur International. See Item 8, Note 5(b) to the Consolidated FinancialStatements for further information.

3)

In July 2003, the Company acquired new offices in London for its London headquarters. The acquisition was by a purchase, sale and leaseback transaction resulting in net cash received of $45.3 million, which was recordedas a deferred liability at December 31, 2003. The Company also recorded a capitalized lease asset and liability of approximately $150.0 million related to this transaction and there were no significant capital expenditures for leaseholdimprovements during 2003. See Item 8, Note 18(d) to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Cash Flow provided by Financing Activities

     Cash flows related to financing activities include the payment of dividends, share related transactions, the issue or repayment of debt and deposit liability transactions. In 2005 and 2004, theCompany received $2.0 billion and $1.5 billion of net cash relating to new deposit liability contracts. In 2005, dividends paid were $276.7 million for ordinary shares and $40.3 million for preferred shares.

     In addition, in the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 the Company executed a number of debt and equity transactions which affect the cash flow from financing activities describedbelow in “Capital Resources”.

Capital Resources

     In addition to ordinary share capital, the Company depends on external sources of financing to support its underwriting activities in the form of:

a.     

ordinary share capital,

b.

debt,

91

c.     

preference shares,

d.

contingent capital, and

e.

letters of credit facilities and other sources of collateral.

In particular, the Company requires, among other things:
Sufficient capital to maintain its financial strength, claims paying and debt ratings, as issued by several
 ratings agencies, at levels considered necessary by management to enable theCompany's key operating
 subsidiaries to compete.Sufficient capital to enable its underwriting subsidiaries to meet the capital adequacy tests performed by
 statutory agencies in the U.S., the U.K., and other key markets.Letters of credit and other forms of collateral that are required by the Company's non-U.S. operating companies that are “non-admitted” under U.S. state insuranceregulations. The Company also uses letters of
 credit to support its operations at Lloyd's.Revolving credit to meet short-term liquidity needs.

     The Company's principal credit facilities are multi-year transactions with maturities in 2007 and 2010, however, the Company has other credit facilities that will expire in 2006. Thefollowing risks are associated with the Company's requirement to renew these facilities during 2006:

The credit available from banks may be reduced resulting in the Company's need to pledge its investment
 portfolio to customers. This could result in a lower investment yield.The volume of business that the Company's non-admitted subsidiaries are able to transact could be reduced
 if the Company is unable to renew its letter of credit facilities at anappropriate amount.

     Continued consolidation within the banking industry may result in the aggregate amount of credit provided to the Company being reduced. The Company attempts to mitigate this risk by identifyingand/or selecting additional banks that can participate in the credit facilities upon renewal.

a) Ordinary Share Capital

     In December 2005, the Company issued 38.9 million ordinary shares at a price of $65.0 per share to support capital requirements subsequent to the 2005 Atlantic hurricane losses and the lossrelated to the conclusion of the independent actuarial process with WSIC. The net proceeds from this issuance were $2.4 billion. See Item 8, Note 19, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

b) Debt

     At December 31, 2005, banks and investors provided the Company and its subsidiaries with $4.6 billion of debt capacity, of which $3.4 billion was utilized by the Company. Thesefacilities consist of:

Revolving credit facilities of $1.2 billion in aggregate. 

The Company had $45 million outstanding at
 December 31, 2005, under its syndicatedrevolving credit facilities and this borrowing was repaid in
 January 2006. These revolving credit facilities (and their predecessor facilities) were not utilized during
 2004. Of the$1.2 billion, $1.0 billion is provided by the Company's $2.0 billion 3-year syndicated facility
 that matures in June 2007, and its $2.35 billion 5-year syndicated facility that matures in June2010. Both
 facilities provide letters of credit in addition to the revolving credit sublimit. In addition, at December 31,
 2005, the Company had two bilateral revolving creditfacilities of $100 million each, of which one facility
 is a 364-day facility that matures in December 2006, and the other is a 5-year facility that matures in
 August2010.

92

At December 31, 2004, the Company had a $600 million revolving credit sublimit provided by a $2.0 billion 3-year facility and a $1.0 billion 364-day facility. In addition, afurther $60 million of revolving credit
 was provided on a bilateral basis under a 364-day facility. These facilities were provided on an unsecured
 basis by a syndicate of banks(the $2.0 billion and $1.0 billion facilities) and on a bilateral basis in the case
 of the $100 million facility.
Senior Unsecured Notes of approximately $3.4 billion. 

These notes require the Company to pay a fixed
 rate of interest during their lives. AtDecember 31, 2005, there were six outstanding issues of senior unsecured notes:$255 million senior notes due April 2011, with a fixed coupon of 6.58%. These notes were privately placed
 and are not traded on a public exchange.$600 million senior notes due January 2012, with a fixed coupon of 6.5%. The security is publicly traded.
 The notes were issued at $99.469 and gross proceeds were $596.8 million.Related expenses of the offering
 amounted to $7.9 million.$600 million senior notes due September 2014, with a fixed coupon of 5.25%. The security is publicly
 traded. The notes were issued in two tranches of $300 million aggregate principalamount each - one
 tranche at 99.432% and the other at 98.419%. Aggregate gross proceeds were $593.6 million. Related
 expenses of the offering amounted to $4million.$350 million senior notes due November 2024, with a fixed coupon of 6.375%. The security is publicly
 traded. The notes were issued at 100.000% and gross proceeds were $350 million.Related expenses of the
 offering amounted to $2 million.$825 million of senior notes due May 2009, with a fixed coupon of 2.53%. These securities are a component of 6.50% Equity Security Units (the “6.50% Units”) that are publiclytraded. In addition to the coupon
 paid on the senior notes, contract adjustment payments of 3.97% per annum are paid on forward purchase
 contracts for the Company's common sharesfor a total distribution of 6.50% per annum. The purchase
 contracts mature in 2007, and the senior notes mature in 2009. In May 2007, the senior notes will be
 remarketed whereby theinterest rate will be reset in order to generate sufficient remarketing proceeds to
 satisfy the 6.50% Unit holders' obligations under the purchase contract.$745 million of senior notes due February 2011 with a fixed coupon of 5.25%. These securities are a component of 7.00% Equity Security Units (the “7.00% Units”) that arepublicly traded. In addition to the
 coupon paid on the senior notes, contract adjustment payments of 1.75% per annum are paid on forward
 purchase contracts for the Company'scommon shares for a total distribution of 7.00% per annum. The purchase contracts mature in 2009, and the senior notes mature in 2011. In February 2009, the senior notes
 will beremarketed whereby the interest rate will be reset in order to generate sufficient remarketing proceeds to satisfy the 7.00% Unit holders' obligations under the purchase contract.

Series A Preferred 

In August 2002, the Company issued 9.2 million of 8% Series A preference ordinary

d) Contingent Capital

     In addition to funded debt transactions, the Company and a majority-owned subsidiary (XL Financial Assurance Ltd. (“XLFA”)) have entered into contingent capital transactions. Noup-front proceeds were received by the Company or XLFA under these transactions, however, in the event that the associated irrevocable put option agreements are exercised, proceeds previously raised from investors from the issuance of pass-throughtrust securities would be received in return for the issuance of preferred shares.

     On December 10, 2004, XLFA entered into a put option agreement and an asset trust expense reimbursement agreement with Twin Reefs Asset Trust (the “Asset Trust”). The put optionagreement provides XLFA with the irrevocable right to require the Asset Trust at any time and from time to time to purchase XLFA's non-cumulative perpetual Series B Preferred Shares with an aggregate liquidation preference of up to $200million. There is no limit to the number of times that XLFA may exercise the put option, redeem the Series B Preferred Shares from the Asset Trust and exercise the put option again. XLFA is obligated to reimburse the Asset Trust for certain fees andordinary expenses. To the extent that any Series B Preferred Shares are put to the Asset Trust and remain outstanding, a corresponding portion of such fees and ordinary expenses will be payable by XLFA pursuant to the asset trust expensereimbursement agreement. The put option agreement is perpetual but would terminate on delivery of notice by XLFA on or after December 9, 2009, or under certain defined circumstances, such as the failure of XLFA to pay the put option premium when dueor bankruptcy. The premium payable by XLFA is the sum of certain trustee and investment managers expenses, the distribution of income paid to holders of the pass-through trust securities, less the investment yield on the eligible assets purchasedusing the proceeds originally raised from the issuance of the pass-through securities.

     In July 2003, the Company entered into a contingent capital transaction with an aggregate value of $500.0 million. This transaction provides the Company with an insurance trust thatprovides the Company with statutory relief under state insurance regulations in the U.S. Under the terms of this facility, the Company has acquired an irrevocable put option to issue preference ordinary shares into a trust in return for proceedsraised from investors. This put option may be exercised by the Company at any time. In addition, the Company may be required to issue preference ordinary shares to the trust under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, the non-paymentof the put option premium and a ratings downgrade of the Company. In connection with this transaction, the fair value of the put premiums and other related costs, in total of $111.9 million was transferred from “Additional paid incapital” to a deferred liability which was established (included with “Other liabilities”) in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2003. The Company amortizes this liability that resulted in an interest expense ofapproximately $3.5 million in 2004 and $2.0 million in 2003.

e) Letter of Credit Facilities and other sources of collateral


     At December 31, 2005, the Company had eight letter of credit facilities in place with total availability of $5.5 billion, of which $3.5 billion was utilized.

     It is anticipated that the commercial facilities will be renewed on expiry but such renewals are subject to the availability of credit from banks utilized by the Company, or other financialinstitutions. In the event that such credit support is insufficient, the Company could be required to provide alternative security to cedents. This could take the form of insurance trusts supported by the Company's investment portfolio or fundswithheld (amounts retained by ceding companies to collateralize loss or premium reserves) using the Company's cash resources or combinations thereof. The face amount of letters of credit required is driven by, among other things, lossdevelopment of existing reserves, the payment pattern of such reserves, the expansion of business written by the Company and the loss experience of such business. In addition to letters of credit, the Company has established insurance trusts in theU.S. that provide cedents with statutory relief required under state insurance regulation in the U.S.

     The Company reviews current and projected collateral requirements on a regular basis, as well as new sources of collateral. Management's objective is to maintain an excess amount ofcollateral sources over expected uses. The Company also reviews its liquidity needs on a regular basis.

     The following letter of credit facilities were originated or renewed during 2005:

In December 2005, the Company created a new $100 million unsecured bilateral credit facility that was
 unutilized during 2005 and at December 31, 2005. The full amount of $100 millionis available as both
 revolving credit and letters of credit, with the combined total not to exceed $100 million.In September 2005, the Company renewed an unsecured bilateral credit facility of $150 million (previously
 $200 million) that was fully utilized at December 31, 2005.In August 2005, the Company created a new unsecured bilateral credit facility of $100 million that was
 unutilized at December 31, 2005.In June 2005, the Company replaced its $1.0 billion 364-day credit and letter of credit facility with a $2.35
 billion facility with a tenor of 5 years. Of the aggregate amount of$2.35 billion, $1.0 billion is available as
 revolving credit and up to $2.25 billion is available in the form of letters of credit, with the combined total
 not to exceed$2.35 billion. As at December 31, 2005, approximately $2.1 billion of the 5-year facility was
 in use in the form of letters of credit.

     In addition to the letter of credit facilities described above, the Company has the following facility:

$500 million commercial paper-based facility. In February 2003, the Company entered into an aggregate of
 $300.0 million of commercial paper-based credit facilities (the “CreditFacilities”). These facilities were
 increased to $500.0 million in June 2003. The proceeds of advances under the Credit Facilities were used
 to fund a trust account tocollateralize the reinsurance obligations of the Company under an inter-company
 quota share reinsurance agreement. The Company could face additional obligations under the Credit
 Facilities prior to the stated maturity of February 25, 2008, if certain events were to occur, including, but
 not limited to the Company's insolvency, withdrawal of assets from the Regulation 114trust by the ceding
 company, the downgrade of the Company's credit ratings below certain specified levels, or the failure of
 the agent to have a first priority perfected securityinterest in the collateral posted by the Company. At
 maturity, the Company will be obligated to make payments in an amount equal to the principal and accrued
 interest outstandingunder the Credit Facilities. The issued securities and the Company's repayment obligations are recorded as a net balance on the Company's balance sheet.

Cross-Default and Other Provisions in Debt Documents


     The following describes certain terms of the documents referred to below. All documents referred to below have been filed with the SEC and should be referred to for an assessment of thecomplete contractual obligations of the Company.

     In general, all of the Company's bank facilities, indentures and other documents relating to the Company's outstanding indebtedness, including the Credit Facilities discussed above(collectively, the “Company's Debt

96

Documents”), contain cross default provisions to each other and the Company's Debt Documents contain affirmative covenants. These covenants provide for, among other things, minimum required ratings of theCompany's insurance and reinsurance operating subsidiaries (other than its AAA financial guaranty companies) and the level of secured indebtedness in the future. In addition, generally each of the Company's Debt Documents provide for anevent of default in the event of a change of control of the Company or some events involving bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company. The Company's credit facilities and the 6.58% Guaranteed Senior Notes also contain minimumconsolidated net worth covenants.

     Under the Company's 364-day facilities, 3-year credit facility, five-year credit facilities placement notes described above, in the event that the Company XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd and XLRe Ltd fail to maintain a financial strength rating of at least “A-” from A.M. Best, an event of default would occur. The Company currently has an “A+ (stable)” rating from A.M. Best.

     Under the Company's ten-year private placement notes described above, in the event that the Company fails to maintain a financial strength rating of at least “A” from A.M. Bestor XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd and XL Re Ltd fail to maintain a financial strength rating of at least “A” from S&P, an event of default would occur. The Company and its subsidiaries currently has an “A+” (stable) rating fromA.M. Best and “A+” (stable) S&P.

     The 6.5% Guaranteed Senior Notes indentures contains a cross default provision. In general, in the event that the Company defaults in the payment of indebtedness in the amount of $50.0million or more, an event of default would be triggered under the Guaranteed Senior Notes indentures. Given that all of the Company's Debt Documents contain cross default provisions, this may result in all holders declaring such debt due andpayable and an acceleration of all debt due under those documents. If this were to occur, the Company may not have funds sufficient at that time to repay any or all of such indebtedness.

     In addition, the Company's unsecured Lloyd's letter of credit facility provides that, in the event that the Company's insurance and reinsurance rated operating subsidiaries inBermuda fall below a rating of “A-”, the facility would then be required to be fully secured by the Company, at which time the Company would be required to either (i) provide an amount in cash to cover an amount equal to the aggregateletters of credit outstanding at that time or (ii) deposit assets in trust securing 105% of the aggregate letters of credit outstanding at that time. If this were to occur, the Company may not be able to provide the collateral required in order tomaintain this facility.

Long-Term Contractual Obligations

     The following table presents the Company's long term contractual obligations and related payments as at December 31, 2005, due by period. This table excludes further commitments of$34.9 million to the Company's related investment funds, certain limited partnerships, insurance affiliates, collateralized debt/equity investments and letter of credit facilities of $3.5 billion.

Deposit liabilities on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2005 amounted to $8,240,987.The difference from the amount included above relates to the discount on payments due in the future.The payment related to these liabilities varies primarily based on interest rates. The ultimate paymentsassociated with these liabilities could differ from the Company's estimate. See Item 8, Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

     (2)     

     The unpaid loss and loss expenses amounted        to $23,767,672 on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet at        December 31, 2005. The timing and amounts of actual claims payments related        to these reserves vary based on many factors including large individual        losses, changes in the legal environment, as well as general market conditions.        The ultimate amount of the claims payments could differ materially from        the Company's estimated amounts. For information regarding the estimates        for unpaid loss and loss expenses as well as factors effecting potential        payment patterns of reserves for actual and potential claims related        the Company's different lines of business see “Critical Accounting        Policies and Estimates” above. Certain lines of business written        by the Company, such as excess casualty, have loss experience characterized        as low frequency and high severity. This may result in significant variability        in loss payment patterns and, therefore, may impact the related asset/liability        investment management process. In order to be in a position, if necessary,        to make these payments, the Company's liquidity requirements are        supported by having revolving lines of credit facilities available to        the Company and significant reinsurance programs, in addition to the        Company's general high grade fixed income investment portfolio.

     (3)

     Future policy benefit reserves on life and        annuity business amounted to $5,606,461 on the Company's Consolidated        Balance Sheet at December 31, 2005. Amounts included above include an        allowance for future premiums in respect of contracts under which premiums        are payable throughout the life of the underlying policy. The value of        the discount is also included for those lines of business that have reserves        where future claim payments and future premium receipts can be estimated        using actuarial principles. The timing and amounts of actual claims payments        and premium receipts related to these reserves vary based on the underlying        experience of the portfolio. Typical elements of the experience include        mortality, morbidity and persistency. The ultimate amount of the claims        payments and premium receipts could differ materially from the Company's        estimated amounts.

     (4)

     Contingent capital facilities related payments        include an estimate at the payments due under the past option agreement        of $200 per month. Actual payments depend on the return on certain        assets and LIBOR.

Variable Interest Entities and Other Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements


     The Company utilizes variable interest entities both indirectly and directly in the ordinary course of the Company's business.

     The Company provides various forms of credit enhancement including financial guaranty insurance and reinsurance of structured transactions backed by pools of assets of specified types,municipal obligations supported by the issuers' ability to charge fees for specified services or projects, and structured single risk-based obligations including essential infrastructure projects and obligations backed by receivables fromfuture sales of commodities and other specified services. The obligations related to these transactions are often securitized through variable interest entities.In synthetic transactions, the Company guarantees payment obligations of counterpartiesincluding special purpose vehicles under credit derivatives referencing assetportfolios. The Company invests in collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”), and other investment vehicles that are issued through variable interest entities aspart of the Company's risk asset portfolio.

     In 2003, the Company entered into an aggregate of $500.0 million of commercial paper-based credit facilities (the “Credit Facilities”). The proceeds of advances under the CreditFacilities were used to fund a trust account (“Trust”) to collateralize the reinsurance obligations of the Company under an intercompany quota share reinsurance agreement. The issued securities and the Company's repayment obligationswill be recorded as a net balance on the Company's balance sheet because the Company has a contractual legal right of offset. In the event that in the future the Company were to not have the right to offset such assets (as, for example, wouldbe the case if the assets in the Trust were withdrawn in order to satisfy the Company's reinsurance obligations or if lender-issued securities could not be held in the Trust because they did not qualify as permitted assets under the trustagreement), then all or a portion of the assets in the Trust and the Company's repayment obligations under the Credit Facilities would be required to be included as assets and liabilities on a gross basis, respectively, on the Company'sbalance sheet. See also “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for more details regarding this off-balance sheet collateral arrangement.

     In December 2004, XLFA entered into a put option agreement and an asset trust expense reimbursement agreement with the Asset Trust. The put option agreement provides XLFA with the irrevocableright to require the Asset Trust at any time and from time to time to purchase XLFA's non-cumulative perpetual Series B Preferred Shares with an aggregate liquidation preference of up to $200 million. XLFA is obligated to reimburse theAsset Trust for certain fees and ordinary expenses. To the extent that any Series B Preferred Shares are put to the Asset Trust and remain outstanding, a corresponding portion of such fees and ordinary expenses will be payable by XLFA pursuant tothe asset trust expense reimbursement agreement. The put option agreement is perpetual but would terminate on delivery of notice by XLFA on or after December 9, 2009, or under certain defined circumstances, such as the failure of XLFA to

98

pay the put option premium when due or bankruptcy. The put option is recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings.

     In July 2003, the Company entered into a contingent capital transaction with an aggregate value of $500.0 million. This transaction also provides the Company with an insurance trust thatprovides the Company with statutory relief under state insurance regulations in the U.S. Under the terms of this facility, the Company has acquired an irrevocable put option to issue preference ordinary shares into a trust in return for proceedsraised from investors. This put option may be exercised by the Company at any time. In addition, the Company may be required to issue preference ordinary shares to the trust under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, the non-paymentof the put option premium and a ratings downgrade of the Company.

ITEM 7A. 

     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK


     The following risk management discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the sensitivity and value-at-risk (“VaR”) analyses presented in this document are forward-lookingstatements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimated results due to, among other things, actual developments in the global financial markets. The resultsof analysis used by the Company to assess and mitigate risk should not be considered projections of future events of losses. See “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Cautionary NoteRegarding Forward-Looking Statements.”

     The Company enters into derivatives and other financial instruments primarily for risk management purposes. The Company's derivative transactions can expose the Company to creditderivative risk, weather and energy risk, investment market risk, and foreign currency exchange rate risk. The Company attempts to manage these risks based on guidelines established by senior management. Derivative instruments are carried at fairvalue with the resulting changes in fair value recognized in income in the period in which they occur.

Credit Derivative Risk

     The Company enters into swaps written under International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) forms as an extension of its financial guaranty business. The fair value isdetermined using models developed by the Company and is dependent upon a number of factors, including changes in interest rates, future default rates, changes in credit quality, future expected recovery rates and other market factors. Other elementsof the change in fair value are based upon pricing established at the inception of the contract. A change in the interest, default and recovery rate assumptions indicated below would cause the fair value associated with credit derivatives todecrease as follows:
