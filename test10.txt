    In general, growth in the telecommunications industry has been    sluggish for the last several years. Demand for some services,    such as wireless and integrated product offerings has increased,    but for many other products and services price compression,    reductions in regulated rates and lower demand have resulted in    year over year revenue declines for many telecommunication    companies. In response to these and other factors, in March 2005    we engaged Jefferies and Company (“Jefferies”) to    present strategic alternatives based on, among other things, the    competitive environment of the telecommunications industry, the    current regulatory environment, and the recent and pending    mergers and acquisitions in our industry. We reviewed    Jefferies' report, and in XMay 2005, we retained Jefferies    to assist us in exploring our strategic alternatives, including    a potential sale of our wireline telecommunications business    (the “Wireline Business”). On November 4, 2005,    XO Communications, Inc. (“XO”), and XO Holdings, Inc.    (“Seller”), entered into an Equity Purchase Agreement    (“the Equity Purchase Agreement”) that provides for    the sale (the “Wireline Sale”) of the Wireline    Business through the sale of all of the outstanding LLC    interests in XO Communications, LLC, a newly formed,    wholly-owned subsidiary of Seller (“XO LLC”), for an    aggregate purchase price of $700 million in cash. Elk    Associates LLC (“Buyer”), an entity owned by XO's    controlling stockholder, Carl Icahn, executed the Equity    Purchase Agreement to purchase the Wireline Business.
